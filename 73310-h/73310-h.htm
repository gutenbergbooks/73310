<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE lectures contained in the present volume I
delivered as Sandars Reader in two series, the first
in the Lent Term 1899, the second in the May Term
1904 and they are thus separated by an interval of five
years. Of the first series a small edition was privately
printed for presentation, but never published, the
second series is now printed for the first time. Though
the second part forms a continuation of the first, the
two are quite distinct. With the close of the fifteenth
century many important changes took place in the
English book-trade, and its conditions altered to a
great extent, so that the period from 1476 to 1500 has
many essential points of difference from the period
between 1501 and 1535 and they can with advantage
be treated separately. I have thought it best therefore
not to attempt to combine the two series, but to issue
them, with certain corrections and additions in their
original form.</p>

<p>It remains to express my sincere thanks to Dr
Jenkinson, the University Librarian who was kind
enough to read the proofs, and to Mr H. G. Aldis to
whom I am indebted for the excellent index.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">LECTURE I.</h2>


<p class="c">THE PRINTERS AT WESTMINSTER.</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">While</span> the history of the invention and introduction
of the art of printing into the various countries
of Europe is not only obscure, but still the subject of
endless controversy, the history of its introduction into
England is now practically settled.</p>

<p>There are no troublesome and incomprehensible
documents as in the case of France. No questionable
references or undatable fragments such as Dutch and
German bibliographers have to contend with. The
only attempt that has been made to bring forward
an earlier printer than William Caxton is founded
upon the misprinted date in the first book printed
at Oxford.</p>

<p>In 1664, while the Company of Stationers and the
King were quarrelling over the question which had
or should have the most power in matters pertaining to
printing, a certain Richard Atkyns put forth a tract,
now exceedingly rare, called <i>The Original and Growth
of Printing</i>. In this tract, intended to uphold the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
King’s rights, attention was drawn for the first time to
the Oxford book. “A book came into my hands,”
writes Atkyns, “printed at Oxford, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1468, which
was three years before any of the recited authors would
allow it to be in England.” Around this book Atkyns
wove a wonderful romance, in the style of the earlier
legends about Coster and Gutenberg. Rumours of the
new art, he suggests, having reached England, trusted
men were sent over to bribe or kidnap an eligible
printer and bring him over secretly, along with a press,
type, and other <i>impedimenta</i>, to England. This was
accordingly done, and a certain Frederick Corsellis was
conveyed into England, and set up a press in Oxford.
One curious point has escaped all commentators on this
story, and that is that a real person named Corsellis did
come over to England from the Low Countries about
that time, and was an ancestor of several well-known
London families in Atkyns’s time, such as the Van
Ackers, the Wittewronges and the Middletons.</p>

<p>Atkyns referred for evidence to documents which
have never been found, and his story has met with
the disbelief it deserved, but the Oxford book with the
date of 1468 not only exists, but still has supporters
who consider, or say they consider, the date to be
genuine.</p>

<p>Singer in the early part of the century wrote a
book in favour of its authenticity, though, as he afterwards
attempted to suppress his work, we may conclude
he had changed his opinion. Mr Madan of the Bodleian,
in his recent admirable history of Oxford printing,
clings hesitatingly to 1468, “but quaere” as he would
himself say. Generally, however it is agreed that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
date is a misprint for 1478. The book has printed
signatures, which are not known to have been used
before 1472, and when the book is placed alongside the
two others issued from the same press in 1479 and
printed in the same type, it falls naturally into its
proper place, taking just the small precedence which
its slightly lesser excellence of workmanship warrants.</p>

<p>Having now disposed of Caxton’s only rival, let us
turn to Caxton himself. It would, I think, be out of
place here to recapitulate however shortly the history
of Caxton’s early life, since it has been so fully and
excellently done in that standard book Blades’s <i>Life of
Caxton</i>. What is more to our purpose is to pass on to
the time when, as an influential and prosperous man, he
laid the foundations of his career as a printer. By 1463
Caxton had been appointed to the office of governor of
the English nation in the Low Countries, a post of
considerable importance, and entailing the supervision
of trade and traders, and this office he held until about
the year 1469. At this latter date he was also in the
service of the Duchess of Burgundy, though in what
capacity is not stated; but he certainly employed himself
at her request in making translations of romances.
The <i>Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye</i>, a well-known
romance of the period, was translated between the years
1469 and 1471, and presented to the duchess in
September of the latter year. In the prologue of the
printed edition Caxton explains that after the duchess
had received her copy, many other persons desired
copies also, but that finding the labour of writing too
wearisome for him, and not expeditious enough for his
friends, he had “practised and learnt, at his great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
charge and expense, to ordain the book in print, to the
end that every man might have them at once.”</p>

<p>Now in 1471, when Caxton finished his translation
of the <i>Recueil</i>, he was living at Cologne, a city remarkable
even at that time for the number of its printers,
and the first town that Caxton had visited where the
art was practised. He had just finished the tedious
copying of a large manuscript, so that the advantages of
printing would be manifest to him; and we may be
tolerably certain that it was about this time and at this
town that he took his first lessons in the art and
mastered the mechanical processes.</p>

<p>Printing by this time had ceased to be a secret art,
nor was there such a demand for books as to make it a
very valuable one. The printed books of Germany had
at an early date found their way to Bruges, and people’s
eyes were accustomed to the sight of the printed page,
though the nobles still preferred manuscripts, as being
more ornamental and costly. There are copies in the Cambridge
University Library and at Lambeth of the <i>Cicero
de officiis</i>, printed at Mainz by Schoiffer in 1466, which
were bought in 1467 at Bruges by John Russell, afterwards
Bishop of Lincoln, when abroad on a diplomatic
mission; and a speech of his, delivered at Ghent in
1470, on the occasion of the investiture of the Duke of
Burgundy with the order of the Garter, was one of
Caxton’s earliest printed productions.</p>

<p>A very strong piece of evidence to my mind that
Caxton learnt at Cologne is to be found in the epilogue
to the English translation of the <i>De proprietatibus
rerum</i>, by Bartholomæus Anglicus, which was printed
by W. de Worde, Caxton’s apprentice and successor, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
1496. This epilogue, written by De Worde himself,
contains these lines:—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And also of your charyte call to remembraunce,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The soule of William Caxton, first prynter of this boke,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In Laten tonge at Coleyn, hymself to avaunce,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">That every well disposyd man, may theron loke.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Now this is a perfectly clear statement that Caxton
printed a <i>Bartholomæus</i> in Latin at Cologne, and we
know an edition of the book manifestly printed at
Cologne about the time Caxton was there. The type
in which it is printed greatly resembles that of some
other Cologne printers, and it seems to be connected
with some of Caxton’s Bruges types. At any rate, the
story cannot be put aside as without foundation. It is
not, of course, suggested that Caxton printed the book
by himself or owned the materials, but only that he
assisted in its production. He was learning the art of
printing in the office where this book was being prepared,
and his practical knowledge was acquired by
assisting to print it.</p>

<p>Returning to Bruges, he set about turning his
knowledge to account, and in partnership with a writer
of manuscripts, named Colard Mansion, began to make
or obtain the necessary materials.</p>

<p>Between the years 1471, when Caxton had learned
the art at Cologne, and 1474, when he set about obtaining
material, printing-presses had started work at
Utrecht, Alost, and Louvain. Caxton would most
naturally turn for assistance to a town in his own
neighbourhood, and there is very little doubt that this
town was Louvain, and that the printer who assisted
him was John Veldener.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>About 1475 their first book was issued, the <i>Recuyell
of the Historyes of Troye</i>, the first book printed in the
English language. It is a small thick folio of 352
leaves, and though not uncommon in an imperfect condition,
is of the very greatest rarity when perfect. Two
other books were printed by 1476, <i>The Game and Playe
of the Chesse</i> and the <i>Quatre derrenières choses</i>, the latter
a very rare book, of which only two copies are known.</p>

<p>In 1476 Caxton obtained a new fount of type, and
leaving the first fount with Colard Mansion, who continued
to use it for a short time, prepared to set out
with his new material for England.</p>

<p>It must have been early in 1476 that Caxton returned
and set to work. He took up his residence in
Westminster at a house with the heraldic sign of the
“Red Pale,” which was situated in the Almonry, a place
close to the Abbey where alms were distributed to the
poor, and where Margaret, Countess of Richmond, the
mother of Henry VII., and a great patroness of learning,
built alms-houses. The exact position of Caxton’s house
is not known, but it was probably on some part of the
ground lately covered by the Westminster Aquarium.</p>

<p>The first dated book printed in England was the
<i>Dictes or Sayengis of the Philosophres</i>, translated from
the French by Earl Rivers, a friend and patron of
Caxton, and edited by Caxton himself, who added the
chapter “concernyng wymmen,” a chapter which, with
its prologue, exhibits a considerable amount of humour.</p>

<p>It is interesting to notice that, as the book is in
English, we alone of European nations started our press
with a book in the vernacular.</p>

<p>The ordinary copies of the <i>Dictes</i> are without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
colophon, though the printer and year are in the
epilogue, but a copy formerly in the Althorp Library
and now at Manchester has an imprint which states
that the book was finished on the 18th November, 1477.
Although we count the <i>Dictes or Sayengis</i> as the first
book printed in England on account of its being the
first dated book, it is quite possible that some may have
preceded it. Between the time of Caxton’s arrival in
1476 and the end of 1478 about twenty-one books were
printed, and only two have imprints, so that the rest
are merely ranged conjecturally by the evidence of type
or other details. Now in 1510 W. de Worde issued an
edition of <i>King Apolyn of Tyre</i>, translated from the
French by one of his assistants, Robert Copland, who
in his preface writes as follows: “My worshipful master
Wynken de Worde, having a little book of an ancient
history of a kyng, sometyme reigning in the countree
of Thyre called Appolyn, concernynge his malfortunes
and peryllous aduentures right espouuentables, bryefly
compyled and pyteous for to here, the which boke I
Robert Coplande have me applyed for to translate out
of the Frensshe language into our maternal Englysshe
tongue at the exhortacion of my forsayd mayster,
accordynge dyrectly to myn auctor, gladly followynge
the trace of my mayster Caxton, begynnynge with
small storyes and pamfletes and so to other.” Now
this Robert Copland was spoken of a little later as the
oldest printer in England, so that he may well have
known a good deal about the beginning of Caxton’s
career. We find a very similar case in Scotland.
Printing was introduced there mainly for the purpose
of printing the Aberdeen <i>Breviary</i>, but the first thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
the printers did was to issue a series of small poetical
pieces by Dunbar, Chaucer, and others, an exactly
similar kind of set to the small Caxton pieces in the
Cambridge University Library.</p>

<p>In connexion with these Caxton pieces I noticed the
other day a strange statement. The writer was speaking
of Henry Bradshaw’s knowledge of Caxton, and
went on to say that “to his bibliographical genius the
Cambridge University Library owes the possession of
its many unique Caxtons and unique Caxton fragments.”
The library, however, owes them mainly to the much-maligned
John Bagford, who collected the early English
books which came to the University with Bishop
Moore’s library. The monstrous collection of title-pages
in the British Museum, generally associated with
Bagford’s name, was made by the venerated founder of
English bibliography, Joseph Ames.</p>

<p>Before the end of 1478 Caxton had printed about
twenty-one books. Of these sixteen were small works,
all containing less than fifty leaves; of the others the
most important is the first edition of the <i>Canterbury
Tales</i>, of which there is, I think, no perfect copy.
Blades speaks of a fine perfect copy in the library of
Merton College, Oxford, and remarks also that Dibdin
ignorantly spoke of it as imperfect. In Dibdin’s time,
however, it certainly was imperfect, for I have seen
some notes of Lord Spencer’s referring to his having
sent some leaves from an imperfect copy to the college
to assist them in perfecting their own, a courtesy which
they repaid by presenting to the library at Althorp their
duplicate and only other known copy of <i>Wednesday’s
Fast</i> printed by W. de Worde in 1532.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>Among the other books of the period of special
interest is the <i>Propositio Johannis Russell</i>, which has
often been ascribed to the Bruges press, as the speech
of which it consists was delivered in the Low Countries.
Lord Spencer’s copy had a curious history. It is bound
up in a volume of English and Latin MSS., and in the
Brand sale in 1807 the volume appeared among the
MSS., with a note, “A work on Theology and Religion
with five leaves at the end, a very great curiosity, very
early printed on wooden blocks, or type.” It was bought
by the Marquis of Blandford for forty-five shillings, and
at his sale ten years after cost Lord Spencer £126.</p>

<p>Another interesting book is the <i>Infancia Salvatoris</i>,
of which the only known copy is at Göttingen, being
one of the two unique Caxtons which are in foreign
libraries. It was originally in the Harleian Library,
which was sold entire to Osborne the bookseller, and
was bought with many other books for the Göttingen
University. It is in its old red Harleian binding, with
Osborne’s price, fifteen shillings marked inside, and the
note of the Göttingen librarian: “aus dem Katalogen
Thomas Osborne in London 12 Maii 1749 (No. 4179)
erkauft.”</p>

<p>In the first group of books comes also the only
printed edition of the <i>Sarum Ordinale</i> or <i>Pica</i>, which
was superseded by Clement Maydeston’s <i>Directorium
Sacerdotum</i>. Unfortunately the book is only known
from some fragments rescued from a binding and now
in the British Museum. To it refers the curious little
advertisement put out by Caxton, the only example of
a printer’s advertisement in England in the fifteenth
century, though we know of many foreign specimens:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
“If it plese ony man spirituel or temporel to bye ony
pyes of two and thre comemoracions of salisburi use,
enpryntid after the forme of this present lettre whiche
ben wel and truly correct, late hym come to westmonester
in to the almonesrye at the reed pale and he shal
haue them good chepe.” So far the advertisement;
below it is the appeal to the public, “Supplico stet
cedula.” It seems curious that this should be in Latin,
for one would naturally suppose that the ones most
likely to tear down the advertisement would be the
persons ignorant of that language.</p>

<p>Two copies of this advertisement are known, one in
the Bodleian, and another, formerly in the Althorp
collection, at Manchester. It has been suggested that
both copies may have been at one time extracted from
some old binding in the Cambridge University Library.
The example at Manchester certainly belonged at one
time to Richard Farmer, who was University Librarian,
but the Bodleian example was found by Francis Douce
in a binding in his own collection.</p>

<p>The group of eight small books in the University
Library which I spoke of as perhaps printed earlier than
the <i>Dictes or Sayengis</i> were originally all bound together
in one volume in old calf, and lettered “Old poetry
printed by Caxton.” This precious volume contained
the <i>Stans Puer ad Mensam</i>, the <i>Parvus Catho</i>, <i>The
Chorle and the Bird</i>, <i>The Horse the Shepe and the Goose</i>,
<i>The Temple of Glas</i>, <i>The Temple of Brass</i>, <i>The Book of
Courtesy</i>, and <i>Anelida and Arcyte</i>, and of five of these
no other copies are known.</p>

<p>About 1478-9 was issued the <i>Rhetorica Nova</i> of
Laurentius of Savona, of which two copies are known,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
one in the Library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge,
the other in the University Library of Upsala. Now
although this book had been known and examined by
many for two hundred years, and is printed in the most
widely used of Caxton’s types, yet it was not recognised
as a Caxton until it was examined by Henry Bradshaw
in 1861. The colophon says that the work was compiled
in the University of Cambridge in 1478, and it
was in consequence described by all the early writers
as the first book printed at Cambridge. Strype wrote
an account of the Corpus copy to Bagford, who in
his turn wrote of it to Tanner, and he in his turn
communicated it to Ames. Ames then inserted it at
the head of his list of books printed at Cambridge, and
the mistake, as is usual in such cases, was copied in
turn by each succeeding writer on printing.</p>

<p>In 1480 considerable changes are to be found in
Caxton’s methods of work, owing no doubt to competition,
for in this year a press was started in London by
a certain John Lettou. He appears to have been a
practised printer, and his work is certainly better than
Caxton’s, his type much smaller and neater, and the
page more regularly printed. He also introduced into
England the use of signatures. Signatures are the
small letters printed at the foot of the page which were
intended to serve as a guide to the bookbinder in
gathering up the sheets. From the earliest times they
were added in writing both to manuscripts and the
earliest printed books, but about 1472 printers began
to print them in type, and the habit soon became
general. Caxton’s use of signatures begins in 1480 and
was doubtless copied from the London printer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>At the beginning of 1480 Caxton had printed an
indulgence in his large type, the second of his founts,
and immediately afterwards the London printer issued
another edition in his small neat type. Caxton promptly
had another fount cut of small type, and issued with it
a third edition of the indulgence.</p>

<p>It is a matter much to be regretted that Henry
Bradshaw never issued one of his <i>Memoranda</i> on the
subject of these indulgences, for he had collected much
interesting information, and was the first to point
out the variations in the wording of the different
issues as well as the discoverer of several unknown
examples.</p>

<p>The year 1481 saw the introduction of illustrations,
which were first used in the <i>Mirror of the World</i>. In
it there are two sets of cuts, one depicting various
masters, either alone or with several pupils, the other are
merely diagrams copied from those found in manuscripts
of the work. These diagrams are meagre and difficult
to understand, so much so that the printer himself has
put several in their wrong places. The explanatory
words inside the diagrams, which would no doubt have
been printed in type had Caxton had a fount small
enough, are written by hand. It is interesting to
notice that in all copies of the book the same handwriting
is found, though I am afraid it would be unsafe
to conclude it to be Caxton’s. The period from 1480 to
1483 is the least interesting as regards Caxton’s books.
Besides the <i>Mirror of the World</i> only two books contain
woodcuts; the <i>Catho</i>, and the second edition of the
<i>Game and Playe of the Chesse</i>. The two cuts in the
<i>Catho</i> had been used before in the <i>Mirror</i>, but the sixteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
in the chess-book are specially cut, though clearly
by a different artist from the one who made those for
the <i>Mirror</i>. Mr Linton in his book on wood-engraving
expressed the opinion that many of these cuts were of
soft metal, treated in the same manner as a wood-block,
but whenever we find any of them in use for a
long period, the breaks which occur in them and the
occurrence sometimes even of worm-holes show that the
cut must have been of wood.</p>

<p>Among the other books of this period are the first
and second editions of <i>Caxton’s Chronicle</i> and <i>Higden’s
Polycronicon</i>. The unique copy of the Latin <i>Psalter</i>
in the British Museum, a Caxton which remained unidentified
until fairly recently, also belongs to about
1480, but perhaps the most interesting book of all is
the first edition in English of <i>Reynard the Fox</i>. This
was translated by Caxton from the Dutch, the translation
being finished in June, 1481, and the book
evidently printed at once. It is curious that this book,
which would lend itself so readily to illustration, was
not printed with woodcuts, but Caxton after using them
in 1481 made no further move in this direction until
1484, when another group of illustrated books appeared.
It always looks as though Caxton, and indeed his own
words tend to prove it, was much more interested in the
literary side of his work than in the mechanical, and
therefore only called in the aid of the wood-engraver
when he thought it absolutely necessary. He wished
his books to be purchased on their merits alone, and
therefore did not try, like the later printers, to use
illustrations merely to attract the unwary purchaser.
On the other hand, as none of the other printers in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
England issued illustrated books, he had no competition
to contend with.</p>

<p>A book which may have been printed about this
time, but if so has entirely disappeared, is a translation
of the <i>Metamorphoses of Ovid</i>. In the Pepysian Library
is a MS. of books x.-xv., with the following colophon:
“Translated and fynysshed by me William Caxton at
Westmestre, the 22 day of Apryll, the yere of our lord
1480 And the 20 yere of the Regne of Kyng Edward
the fourth.” It seems very improbable Caxton would
have taken the trouble to make this translation had he
not intended it to be printed, and he mentions it in
one of his prologues amongst a series of books which he
had translated and printed. This MS. was bought by
Pepys at an auction in 1688.</p>

<p>Another interesting point to be noticed about it is
that it contains the autograph of Lord Lumley who
inherited the library formed by the Earls of Arundel.
Now William Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel, was one of
Caxton’s patrons, and the manuscript may have been
presented to him by Caxton himself.</p>

<p>The period from 1483 to 1486 is more interesting.
First in order comes the first edition of Mirk’s <i>Liber
Festivalis</i> and its supplement the <i>Quattuor Sermones</i>.
The next is a small quarto pamphlet known as the <i>Sex
quam elegantissimæ epistolæ</i>, and consisting of letters
that passed between Sixtus IV. and the Venetian
Republic. The only copy known was found bound up
in a volume of seventeenth century theological tracts in
the library at Halberstadt, and was sold in 1890 to the
British Museum for £200. After these come a series
of English writers, Lidgate’s <i>Life of our Lady</i>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
Chaucer’s <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, and
<i>Hous of Fame</i>; Gower’s <i>Confessio amantis</i>, and the <i>Life
of St Wenefrede</i>. The <i>Canterbury Tales</i> is the second
edition published by Caxton, and has a peculiarly
interesting preface by the printer, in which he tells us
that having some six years before printed the <i>Canterbury
Tales</i>, which were sold to many and divers gentlemen,
one of the number had complained that the text was
corrupt. He said, however, that his father had a very
fine MS. of the poem which he valued highly, but that
he thought he might be able to borrow it. Caxton at
once promised that if this could be done, he would
reprint the book. This second edition is ornamented
with a series of cuts of the different characters, and one
of all the pilgrims seated together at supper at an
immense round table. This cut does duty several
times later on as the frontispiece of Lidgate’s <i>Assembly
of the Gods</i>.</p>

<p>In the same year as the <i>Canterbury Tales</i> appeared
two other illustrated books, the <i>Fables of Esop</i>, and the
<i>Golden Legend</i>. The <i>Esop</i> has one large full-page cut
of Esop used as a frontispiece and which is found only
in the copy at Windsor Castle, and no less than a
hundred and eighty-five smaller cuts, the work of two
if not three engravers, one being evidently the man
who made the cuts for the chess-book.</p>

<p>The <i>Golden Legend</i> is the largest book ever printed
by Caxton. It contains 449 leaves, and is printed on a
much larger-sized paper than he ever used elsewhere,
the full sheet measuring about two feet by sixteen
inches. The frontispiece is a large woodcut representing
the saints in glory, while in addition there are eighteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
large and fifty-two small cuts, the large series including
one of the device of the Earl of Arundel, to whom the
book is dedicated. The three dated books of 1485 are
all especially important. The first is the first edition
of the <i>Morte d’Arthur</i>, surely the most covetable of all
Caxton’s books. For many years only one copy was
known in the library of Osterley Park, and many were
the attempts made by the two great Caxton collectors
in the early years of last century, Lord Spencer and his
nephew, the Duke of Devonshire, to obtain the treasure.
The Duke of Devonshire almost succeeded, but was
foiled by some awkward clause in a deed. However,
another copy appeared at a sale in Wales, wanting
eleven leaves, but otherwise in beautiful condition, and
this was bought by Lord Spencer. The Osterley Park
copy was sold in 1885 for £1950, and went to America,
and after several changes of ownership is now in the
fine library of Mr Hoe of New York. The other two
dated books are the <i>Life of that Noble and Christian
Prince, Charles the Great</i>, and the <i>History of the
Knight Paris and Fair Vienne</i>. Both of these books
were translated by Caxton from the French. Only one
copy of each is known, and both are in the British
Museum.</p>

<p>After 1485 Caxton’s energy began to decline, or at any
rate we know of fewer books having been issued during
the period from 1486 to 1489. The <i>Speculum vitæ
Christi</i> and the <i>Royal Book</i> belong to 1486, and are
illustrated with woodcuts of a very much superior
execution to those which had been previously in use;
they are not large, but are simply and gracefully
designed. Besides the regular series in the <i>Speculum</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
specially cut for it, a few very small and rather roughly
designed cuts are found, evidently cut for use in one of
the editions of the Sarum <i>Horae</i>, which were issued at
an earlier date, but of which nothing now remains but
a few odd leaves. It is interesting to notice that in
neither edition of the <i>Speculum</i> which he printed did
Caxton use the full series of the cuts which had been
engraved for it; for, several years afterwards, one or two
cuts occur in books printed by Caxton’s successor,
evidently part of the series, and which he had never
used himself. To this time may be ascribed the newest
Caxton discovery, two fragments printed on vellum of
an edition of the <i>Donatus Melior</i>, revised by Mancinellus,
which were discovered some few years ago by Proctor
in the binding of a book in the library of New
College, Oxford.</p>

<p>In 1487 Caxton was anxious to issue an edition of
the Sarum <i>Missal</i>, and, not considering his own type
suitable for the purpose, commissioned a Paris printer
named William Maynyal to print one for him. Who
this Paris printer was is a matter of mystery. In 1489
and 1490 he printed two service books for the use of
the Church of Chartres, but is not otherwise known. A
George Maynyal, probably a relation, printed at Paris
about 1480, and M. Claudin conjectures on somewhat
vague grounds, that both were English. The <i>Missal</i> is
a very handsome book, printed in red and black, with
two fine woodcuts at the Canon. The only known copy,
which belongs to Lord Newton of Lyme Park, appears
to have met at an early date with bad treatment, and
wants some seventeen leaves, mostly at the beginning.</p>

<p>In this book for the first time Caxton uses his well-known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
device, consisting of his trade or merchant’s
mark, with his initials on either side.</p>

<p>Whether this device was cut in England or abroad
has long been a vexed question, but as it has no
resemblance to any foreign device of the period, and as
the execution is poor and coarse, we may conclude
safely that it is of native work. Caxton, no doubt,
wished to call attention to the fact, which might have
escaped notice, that the book was produced for him and
at his cost; and so when the copies of the book had
been delivered to him at Westminster he had the device
cut, and stamped it on the last leaf of each copy. In
this edition the portion of the marriage service in
English has been omitted by the printer, who has left
blank spaces for it to be filled in with the pen. There
was an edition of the Sarum <i>Legenda</i> issued about the
same time, which is known now only from a few odd
leaves rescued from book-bindings. It agrees in every
way typographically with the <i>Missal</i>, it is in the same
type, has the same number of lines to the page, every
detail the same, so I think we have good reason for
supposing that it also was printed by Maynyal for
Caxton. Bradshaw suggested Higman, the Paris printer,
as the printer of these fragments, so that Maynyal may
have had some business connexion with him.</p>

<p>The second edition of the <i>Golden Legend</i> came out
shortly after this, that is about 1488, and is a difficult
book to explain typographically. About 200 leaves are
of the first edition, while the beginning, a small piece
of the middle, and the end are of the second. Now it
is curious that no copy in existence seems to be correctly
made up with the full number of second edition leaves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
and the most probable explanation seems to be that part
of the stock happening to get damaged, a reprint was
made to complete what was left, and that sheets were
picked indiscriminately. The most nearly perfect second
issue that I have seen is the one at Aberdeen, but it
is imperfect at beginning and end. The copy in the
Hunterian Museum at Glasgow has a second edition
ending, and also part of the first quire of the second
issue.</p>

<p>In 1489 two editions of an indulgence from Joannes
de Gigliis were issued, printed in a type used nowhere
else by Caxton and not mentioned by Blades. The
earliest noticed of these indulgences was discovered in
the following manner. Cotton, who found it at Dublin,
published an account of it in the second series of his
<i>Typographical Gazetteer</i> in 1862, and he there described
it as a product of the early Oxford press. Bradshaw
obtained a photograph of it, and at once conjectured
from the form and appearance of the type that it was
printed by Caxton. He immediately communicated his
discovery to Blades, who, however, refused to accept it
as a product of Caxton’s press without further proof, and
it was never mentioned in any edition of his books on
that printer. The necessary proof was soon afterwards
forthcoming, for Bradshaw found that in a book printed
by W. de Worde in 1494, the sidenotes were in this
identical type, and as De Worde was the inheritor
of all Caxton’s material, this fount must have belonged
to him.</p>

<p>About the same year were issued two unique books,
<i>The History of Blanchardin and Eglantine</i>, and the
<i>Four Sons of Aymon</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>The <i>Blanchardin</i> is unfortunately imperfect, wanting
all the end, and it is impossible to say of how much this
consisted. The <i>Four Sons of Aymon</i> is also imperfect,
wanting a few leaves at the beginning. Both books
were formerly in the Spencer Library. The <i>Doctrinal
of Sapience</i> published in 1489 is a translation by Caxton
from a French version, and one particular copy of it in
the Royal library at Windsor is worthy of special
notice. It is printed throughout upon vellum, a
material which Caxton hardly ever used, the only other
complete book so printed being a copy of the <i>Speculum
Vitæ Christi</i> in the British Museum. This particular
copy of the <i>Doctrinal</i> has also a special chapter added
“Of the negligences happyng in the masse and of the
remedyes” which is not found in any other copy.
That it was specially printed is evident from its concluding
words, “This chapitre to fore I durst not sette in
the boke by cause it is not conuenyent ne aparteynyng
that euery layman sholde knowe it.”</p>

<p>During the last year or two of his life most of the
books issued by Caxton were of a religious nature.
Some would have us believe that this was owing to
illness or a premonition of his own approaching end,
some to the fact that his wife, if the Maud Caxton who
was buried in 1490 was his wife, was just dead. Both
these ideas seem to me rather fanciful. He no doubt
printed what was most in demand. One book issued
about this time was certainly not religious. It is a free
paraphrase of some portions of the <i>Æneid</i> and was
translated by Caxton from the French. It does not
pretend to be a translation of the original, but was
abused soundly by Gavin Douglas, who issued a translation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
in 1553, for its many inaccuracies. Amongst the
religious books I may mention the <i>Ars Moriendi</i>, a little
quarto of eight leaves, which was discovered by Henry
Bradshaw in a volume of tracts in the Bodleian, and of
which no other copy is known, and the very interesting
<i>Commemoratio lamentationis beate Marie</i>, which is in
the University Library at Ghent and which is one of the
two unique Caxtons on the Continent. It was, I
believe, picked up by one of the librarians bound in a
volume of tracts and by him presented to the University
Library. This Caxton bought for a trifle in Belgium
may be considered as the real successor to the imaginary
one picked off the stall in Holland by the celebrated
Snuffy Davy of the <i>Antiquary</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Fifteen Oes</i> is another of these religious books.
Its name is taken from the fact that each of the fifteen
prayers of which it is composed begins with O, and it
was printed as a supplement to a Sarum <i>Horæ</i>, with
later editions of which it was generally incorporated.
It contains a beautiful woodcut of the Crucifixion, and
is also the only existing book printed by Caxton which
had borders round the pages. That a <i>Horae</i> to accompany
it was printed is most probable, for the Crucifixion
is only one of a set of cuts which was used, together
with the borders, in an edition printed about 1494.</p>

<p>Though most of the books at this time can only be
arranged conjecturally it is probable that the last book
printed by Caxton was the <i>Book of Divers Ghostly
Matters</i>. It consists really of three tracts, each separately
printed, the <i>Seven Points of True Love</i>, the
<i>Twelve Profits of Tribulation</i>, and the <i>Rule of St Benet</i>;
but as they are always found bound together, they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
classed as one book. There is one cut in the second
treatise taken from the <i>Speculum</i> series, but no other
illustrations.</p>

<p>Caxton used during his career eight founts of type,
of which six only are included in Blades’s enumeration.
The late French type which appeared about 1490-91,
and is found in a few of the latest books, such as the
<i>Ars Moriendi</i> and the <i>Fifteen Oes</i>, Blades considered
not to have been used until after Caxton’s death; and
the type of the 1489 indulgences was not mentioned at
all. Blades’s arrangement, too, of the books under their
types, though correct in a certain way, is a very misleading
one, for he takes the types in their order, and
then arranges all the books under the type in which the
body of the book is printed. Now this leads to considerable
confusion when different types were in use together.
For instance, Caxton started at Westminster
with types 2 and 3, and both are used in his first book,
but Blades puts the books in type 3 after all those in
type 2, and thus the Sarum <i>Ordinale</i>, perhaps the
second book printed in England, certainly one of the
earliest, comes thirty-sixth on his list. Now, though
Blades’s arrangement was not a chronological one, most
writers have made the mistake of thinking so, and have
followed it as such, as may be seen, for instance, in the
list appended to Caxton’s life in the <i>Dictionary of
National Biography</i>, which follows Blades’s arrangement
without any reference to his system or mention of the
types.</p>

<p>Caxton printed in England ninety-six separate books,
and, counting in the three printed by him at Bruges,
and the Sarum <i>Missal</i>, altogether one hundred, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
which ninety-four are mentioned by Blades. It is true
that Blades describes ninety-nine books, but he includes
two certainly printed at Bruges after Caxton had left,
and three printed by De Worde after Caxton’s death.
But it is not the mere number of the books he printed
that makes Caxton’s career so remarkable, but the fact
that he edited almost every book he issued, and
translated a large number. He himself says that he
had translated twenty-two, and the statement was made
at a time previous to his making several others, and
when we consider that amongst his translations is to be
included such a large book as the <i>Golden Legend</i>, we
can only wonder that he printed as much as he did.</p>

<p>Of the exact date of his death we have no evidence,
but it evidently must have taken place in 1491. It is
unfortunate, too, that no copy of his will has been
preserved; for the collection of documents in Westminster
Abbey, where it might, with most probability,
have been expected to be found, has been searched in
vain. The will, besides the interesting personal details
which it might supply, would most likely give some
information about those engaged with him in business,
the assistants who worked his presses, or the stationers
who sold his books.</p>

<p>Of his family we know next to nothing. We know
that he was married and had a daughter named Elizabeth,
who was married to a merchant named Gerard
Croppe, from whom she obtained a deed of separation in
1496. Had Caxton had a son he would probably have
continued the printing business. As it was the printing
materials were inherited by his assistant or apprentice
Wynkyn de Worde, who continued to carry on work in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
his old master’s house at Westminster. In his letters
of denization, taken out so late as the 20th April, 1496,
he is described as a printer, and a native of the Duchy
of Lorraine. His name, De Worde, which some have
fallen into the mistake of deriving from the town of
Woerden in Holland, is clearly taken from the town of
Wörth in Alsace; indeed, the printer sometimes uses
the form Worth in place of Worde. Although he inherited
Caxton’s business, which was no doubt a flourishing
one, he seems to have started on his own account
with very little vigour or enterprise. Indeed, so torpid
was the press at that time that foreign printers found
it worth their while to produce and import reprints of
Caxton’s books for sale in this country, books to which
I shall refer more fully in a future lecture. We soon
see that we have to deal now with a man who was
merely a mechanic, and who was quite unable to fill the
place of Caxton either as an editor or a translator, one
who preferred to issue small popular books of a kind to
attract the general public, rather than the class of book
which had hitherto been published from Caxton’s
house.</p>

<p>For the first two years De Worde contented himself
with using Caxton’s old types, of which he appears to
have possessed at least five founts, and in that time he
printed five books, the <i>Book of Courtesy</i>, the <i>Treatise of
Love</i>, the <i>Chastising of God’s Children</i>, the <i>Life of
St Katherine</i>, and a third edition of the <i>Golden Legend</i>.
Why this book should have been so often printed is
rather a mystery, for, while Caxton issued two editions
and De Worde another two before 1500, at the end of
the century a considerable number of Caxton’s edition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
still remained for sale at the price of thirteen shillings
and fourpence, not a large sum for those days and considering
the size of the book.</p>

<p>The <i>Book of Courtesy</i>, which is known only from
two leaves in the Douce collection at Oxford, was
a reprint from Caxton’s edition, of which the only
known copy is in the Cambridge University Library.
In the waste leaves in the Bodleian, De Worde’s device
is printed upside-down, and for this reason perhaps the
sheet was rejected and used to line a binding, and thus
preserved for us. The <i>Treatise of Love</i> was printed for
the translator, whose name unfortunately does not
appear, but the translation is dated 1493, and the
printing is clearly of the same year. The <i>Chastising of
God’s Children</i>, a deplorably dull book, is interesting
typographically as being the first book printed at
Westminster with a title-page. Why Caxton never
introduced this improvement it is hard to say, for he
must have seen many books in which they were used,
and a book with one was printed at London before his
death.</p>

<p>The imprint of the <i>Golden Legend</i> is curious, for
though it is dated 1493 it contains Caxton’s name. De
Worde seems to have reprinted from an earlier edition,
merely altering the date, or perhaps he meant the
words “By me William Caxton” to refer to the translator
rather than the printer.</p>

<p>In 1493, very nearly at the close of the year, De
Worde’s first type makes its appearance in an edition of
the <i>Liber Festivalis</i>, the second or companion part of
the book, the <i>Quattuor Sermones</i>, coming out early in
1494. The type has a strong French appearance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
though it retains several characteristics and even a few
identical letters of Caxton’s founts. It is curious that
up to this time De Worde had not put his name to any
book, though most of them contain his first device, a
copy on a small scale of Caxton’s, and evidently cut in
metal.</p>

<p>In 1494 two important books were issued, the <i>Scala
perfeccionis</i> of Walter Hylton, a Carthusian monk, and
a reprint of the <i>Speculum Vitæ Christi</i>, both being in the
late French type of Caxton. The <i>Scala perfeccionis</i> is
a rare book when it contains the last part, which is
only found in two or three copies. It has on the title-page
a woodcut of the Virgin and Child under a canopy,
and below this the sentence beginning “Sit dulce
nomen domini nostri Jesu Christi benedictum,” but the
engraver in cutting the block has not attempted to cut
the words properly, but merely to give their general
appearance, so that the result though decorative is
almost impossible to decipher.</p>

<p>The <i>Speculum</i> of this year has many points of
interest, the chief perhaps being that Caxton’s small
type No. 7 is found in it, the only time it is used in a
printed book, though it had been used before in 1489
for printing indulgences. The text of the book is in
Caxton’s French type, but the sidenotes are in this small
Caxton type up to about the middle of the book,
whence the notes are continued in the same type as the
text. Up till a year or two ago only one copy of this
book was known, in Lord Leicester’s library at Holkham,
but lately another copy, imperfect and in bad condition,
turned up amongst some rubbish in the offices of a
solicitor at Birkenhead, and is now in the Rylands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
Library at Manchester. Three editions of the <i>Horae
ad usum Sarum</i>, two in quarto and one in octavo,
printed in the same type as the other two books, may
also be ascribed to 1494. The two in quarto are
evidently reprinted from the last edition of Caxton’s of
which the little treatise called the <i>Fifteen Oes</i> formed
part, for they have the same borders, and the woodcuts
are clearly of sets which belonged to Caxton. The
octavo edition is quite different, having no borders, and
the woodcuts so far as is known, for the book is only
known from a fragment, belong to a set which do not
appear to have been used again.</p>

<p>The most famous of the cuts used at this time is
one of the Crucifixion formerly used by Caxton in the
<i>Fifteen Oes</i>, of which a facsimile is given by Dibdin in the
second volume of his <i>Typographical Antiquities</i>, page 79.
He erroneously remarks about it in another place, “The
woodcut of the Crucifixion was never introduced by
Caxton, it is too spirited and elegant to harmonise
with anything that he ever published.” It was used
frequently after this time by De Worde, and affords us
towards the end of the century one of the most useful
date-tests for undated books. Between May, 1497, and
January, 1498, part of the cap of the soldier who stands
on the right of the cross was broken away, so that any
book containing this cut with the cap entire must be
before 1498. In 1499 the cut began to split, and in
1500 it split right across. Towards the end of 1500
one of the two border lines at top and bottom was cut
away. Of course there are for De Worde’s books many
date-tests, and when they can be worked in various
ways and in conjunction, the result may be taken as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
very fairly accurate. If it were only possible to get
once together all the scattered undated books for comparison,
they could easily be arranged in their exact
order.</p>

<p>In 1495 appeared the <i>Vitas Patrum</i>, “the moste
vertuouse hystorye of the deuoute and right renowned
lyves of holy faders lyvynge in deserte, worthy of
remembraunce to all wel dysposed persones, whiche
hath be translated out of Frenche into Englisshe by
Wylliam Caxton of Westmynstre, late deed, and
fynysshed at the laste daye of his lyff.” The delay in
the bringing out of this work may be due to the large
number of illustrations, for it is profusely illustrated; the
cuts, however, are very rudely designed and engraved.</p>

<p>In the Pepysian Library at Cambridge is a unique
edition of the <i>Introductorium linguæ latinæ</i>, edited
very likely by Horman, which has the words in the
preface, “Nos sumus in anno salutis Millesimo
quadringentesimo nonagesimo quinto (1495),” which
I certainly take to be the year of printing, especially as
another edition of the same book in the Bodleian, also
unique, has the last word of the date, quinto, altered to
nono, and must have been printed before July, 1499.
The small tracts printed from 1495 to 1497 are very
difficult to date with any precision, but there are a few
of particular interest which may be ascribed to that
period, such books, for instance, as the <i>Information for
Pilgrims to the Holy Land</i>, a work well worth reading
for amusement, which cannot be said of many of these
books; Fitzjames’s <i>Sermo die lune in ebdomada Pasche</i>,
the <i>Sermo pro episcopo puerorum</i>, the <i>Mirror of
Consolation</i>, and the <i>Three Kings of Cologne</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>1496 is the year usually ascribed to the edition of
Trevisa’s translation of the <i>De proprietatibus rerum</i> of
Bartholomæus Anglicus, and I quoted earlier four lines
of verse saying that Caxton had printed the book in
Latin at Cologne. The three last lines of the same
stanza referring to another matter are also very interesting.
Having spoken of Caxton it continues:—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And John Tate the yonger joye mote he broke</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whiche late hathe in Englond doo make this paper thynne</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That now in our englyssh this boke is prynted inne.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>The watermark of this paper is an eight-pointed star in
a circle. The supply of this paper does not appear to
have been kept up for long, for I have only found it in
two other English books. The <i>Bartholomæus</i> contains
some very good woodcuts, finer than others of the
period, and the press-work seems rather more regular
than usual, so that perhaps we may accept the
statement of Dibdin that “Of all the books printed in
this country in the fifteenth century, the present one is
the most curious and elaborate, and probably the most
beautiful for its typographical execution.” It is only
fair to say, however, that the copy described by Dibdin
was a very exceptional one. In 1496 also came out a
reprint of the well-known <i>Book of St Alban’s</i>, as it is
generally called, a treatise on hunting, hawking, and
heraldry, with the addition in this issue of the delightful
chapter on fishing with an angle, our earliest printed
treatise on the art. There is a woodcut of the angler at
the beginning, and we see him busily at work with a
large tub beside him, just like the German fisher of to-day,
into which he may put his fish and keep them
alive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>This book would naturally appeal especially to the
richer class, and De Worde not only took especial pains
with it, but struck off copies upon vellum, some of
which have come down to our own day. From a
typographical point of view the book is of great interest,
for it is printed throughout in a foreign type which
made its appearance in England on this occasion only.
It was used at Gouda by Govaert van Os, but he seems
to have discarded it about 1490 when he removed to
Copenhagen. Besides acquiring this fount De Worde
also obtained a number of woodcut capital letters,
which are used in all his earliest books, and one or two
woodcuts, which he used frequently until they were
broken and worn out. It has always been a puzzle to
me why, if De Worde had had this fount of type beside
him for several years, he never used it before, and why,
having used it this once, he never used it again. Not
a single letter ever appears in another book, and yet
the type is a handsome one.</p>

<p>1498 saw the issue of three fine folios: the <i>Morte
d’Arthur</i>, of which the only known copy is in the John
Rylands Library at Manchester, the <i>Golden Legend</i>, of
which the only known perfect copy is in the same
library, and lastly the <i>Canterbury Tales</i> of Chaucer.
The only perfect copy of this book was sold lately in
the Ashburnham sale for £1000, and is now in a private
library in America. The first of these three books, the
<i>Morte d’Arthur</i>, is a reprint of Caxton’s edition, but it
differs from it in having illustrations. These are no
doubt of native workmanship, and might be justly
described as the worst ever put into an English book,
being coarsely drawn, badly designed, and incompetently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
engraved. The <i>Golden Legend</i> is a mere reprint of the
earlier editions, but is interesting for two points in the
colophon. The first is an example of the carelessness
of the printers. The words in the earlier editions run,
“Thus endeth the legend named in latin legenda aurea,
that is to say in Englysshe the golden legende, for lyke
as golde passeth all other metals, so this legende
exceedeth all other books, wherein be contained all the
high and great feasts of our lord” and so on. In this
edition a line has been omitted, and the words run,
“For like as golde passeth all other metalles, wherein
ben contained all the highe and grete festes of our
lord.” Now although the omission makes nonsense
of the whole sentence, it is reprinted exactly the same in
the later editions issued by De Worde and Julian Notary.</p>

<p>The other point is the date in the colophon, which
runs, “Fynysshed at Westmynster, the viii day of
Janeuer, the yere of oure lorde Thousande . cccc. lxxxxviii.
And in the xiii year of the reygne of kynge
Henry the VII.” Now as the 13th year of Henry VII
ran from August 22, 1497, to August 21, 1498, it is
clear that De Worde in speaking of January 8, 1498,
meant 1498 as we would calculate, and not 1499, and
therefore that he began his year on the first of January
and not on the 25th of March, a most important point to
be settled in arranging dated books. Another later proof
as to De Worde’s dating may be mentioned. In the tracts
which he printed between January 1 and March 25,
1509, he speaks of himself as printer to the king’s
mother, but after Henry VIII succeeded in 1509 he
styles himself printer to the king’s grandmother, so
that he clearly used our method of dating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>About the year 1498, De Worde introduced his
second device, the largest of the three used in the
fifteenth century. It is almost square, with a broad
border, and having Caxton’s mark and initials above a
flowering plant. Between July and December, 1499, a
series of small nicks was cut all round the outside
edge, and this gives us a useful clue to checking the
dates of several books.</p>

<p>In 1499, De Worde brought out an edition of <i>Mandeville’s
Travels</i>. It was not the first edition published
in England by a year or two, but it was the first with
illustrations, and most realistic illustrations they are.
No doubt it was a very popular book, and the two
copies known, one in the Cambridge University
Library, the other at Stonyhurst, are both imperfect.
Fortunately by means of the two we can obtain an
exact collation. This year seems to have been a very
busy one. While the dated books in the other years of
the fifteenth century never rise above four, in this year
there are ten, and a considerable number of undated
books can be assigned to this year as well. Among
them are a number of small poetical pieces by Lidgate,
reprints of Caxton’s editions. One of these reprints
shows how careless a printer W. de Worde was. He
reprints the <i>Horse, the Shepe, and the Ghoos</i>, from a
copy of Caxton’s wanting a leaf, but never noticing anything
wrong prints straight ahead, making of course
nonsense of the whole.</p>

<p>All De Worde’s quarto tracts were got up in the
same style, the title at the top of the first leaf printed
in one of Caxton’s types, below this a woodcut not
always very apposite to the subject of the work. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
were two stock cuts of masters with large birches and
their pupils seated before them, one of these being
among the material obtained from Govaert van Os.
These of course were suitable for grammars and school-books.
Caxton’s cuts for the Sarum <i>Horae</i>, the
Crucifixion, The tree of Jesse, the three rioters and
three skeletons, the rich man and Lazarus, and David
and Bathsheba, came in very useful for theological
books. The only special cut, that is, one specially cut
for the particular book and not belonging to a series, that
I have found, is that on the title of the <i>Rote or mirror of
consolation</i>, which depicts seven persons kneeling before
an altar, above which two angels hold a monstrance.</p>

<p>At the end of the year 1500, De Worde moved from
Westminster into Fleet Street at the sign of the Sun,
the earliest book from the new address being dated
May, 1501. This from the point of view of the
bibliographer was an extremely well-timed move, for
we can at once put all books with the Westminster
imprint as before 1501, and all with the London one
after 1500, thus dividing clearly the fifteenth and
sixteenth century books. At the time of his moving he
seems to have got rid of a considerable portion of his
stock; some seems to have been destroyed and some
sold, for many cuts which had belonged to De Worde or
to Caxton are found afterwards in books printed by
Julian Notary. De Worde seems to have been a
successful business man, for when he moved into Fleet
Street he occupied two houses close to St Bride’s
Church, one his dwelling-house and the other a printing-office,
for which he paid the very high tithe rent of
sixty-six shillings and eightpence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>The number of books printed by Wynkyn de Worde
in the fifteenth century, counting in different editions
of the same book, is 110, and of a considerable number
of these only a single copy is known. It would seem
probable that the printer, when issuing a small book,
printed only a small number of copies, preferring to set
up the type for a new edition rather than burden
himself with much unsaleable stock. And it is curious
how these various editions have been accidentally
preserved. Only two copies are known of a book called
the <i>Rote or mirror of consolation</i>, printed by De Worde
in the fifteenth century, one of them is in the Pepysian
library, the other in Durham Cathedral. Yet these two
are of quite different editions, the one at Durham being
certainly about 1496, the other certainly after the
middle of 1499. Of the <i>Three Kings of Cologne</i> we
have two editions, though only three copies are known.
Indeed, for some time it was thought that each copy
represented a different edition, as the copy in the
British Museum, evidently bound up separately out of
a volume of tracts, had had the last page of the tract
preceding it bound in in place of the correct title-page.</p>

<p>Looking at the very large number of small books
which De Worde printed between the end of 1496 and
1500, it is surprising how many are known from single
copies. I have kept for many years a register of all the
copies of early English books which are to be found anywhere,
and taking the quartos printed by W. de Worde,
which number altogether 70, I find that out of that
number 47, that is more than two-thirds, are known to
us now from single copies or fragments. And I feel
certain that we owe the preservation of the majority of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
these to a cause we are now doing our best to destroy.
A few worthy people centuries ago made collections of
these tracts and bound them up in immensely stout
volumes, which gave them an air of importance in
themselves, and tended to preserve the tracts inside in
a much better manner than if bound separately. I do
not think I am exaggerating when I say that a hundred
and fifty of the rarest that De Worde printed during
his whole life would have been found a hundred
years or so ago bound up in about twelve volumes.
Some twenty-two of the rarest of W. de Worde’s in the
Heber Library came to him in one volume. Thirteen
unique tracts which sold at the Roxburghe sale for
£538, were in a single volume when the Duke purchased
them fourteen years before for £26. I need only refer
you to the University Library, a large number of whose
unique Caxton and De Worde tracts came in three or
four volumes. Then again, when so many are known
only from fragments or single copies we may imagine
what a large number have absolutely disappeared.</p>

<p>Some have been lost of late years or have disappeared
since they were described. Three unique W.
de Worde books of the fifteenth century were supposed
to have perished in a fire in Wales in 1807 but
fortunately they had been sold by the owner of the
library a short time before the fire. Others seem to
have drifted into libraries whose owners know nothing
about them. There is a unique De Worde printed
before 1501, entitled the “<i>Contemplacyon or meditacyon
of the shedynge of the blood of our lorde Jhesu Cryste at
seven tymes</i>.” This was seen and described by Herbert,
who very likely saw it when it was sold at the Fletewode<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
sale in 1774. Since then we have no record of the
book, and though every year more information about
private collections is published I can come upon no
trace of it.</p>

<p>Beside the genuine books which have disappeared,
by this I mean books which have been described by a
trustworthy bibliographer, there are others which may
reasonably be supposed to have existed, and one clue to
these is afforded by the woodcuts. W. de Worde for
example had certain series of cuts, specially made for
certain books; but when he wished to decorate the
title-page of a small tract, which was not itself to be
otherwise illustrated, he used an odd cut out of his sets.
Now when we can trace in different tracts odd cuts,
manifestly belonging to a series, we may reasonably
suppose that the book for which the series was engraved
must have been printed.</p>

<p>To give a couple of instances. In the unique copy
of Legrand’s <i>Book of good manners</i> in the University
Library without date, but printed about the middle of
1498, are two cuts, which really belong to a series made
to illustrate the <i>Seven wise masters of Rome</i>. These
cuts are fairly accurate copies of those used by Gerard
Leeu in his edition of 1490. At a considerably later
date De Worde did issue an edition of the <i>Seven wise
masters</i>, illustrated with the series of which the two
mentioned above formed part, and showing at that time
marks of wear. Now as De Worde had the series cut
by the beginning of 1498, I think it most probable that
an edition of the book was then issued, for it is unlikely
that he would go to the trouble of cutting the set
unless he was preparing to print the book.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f2">
<img src="images/fig2.jpg" alt="boke">
<p class="caption">There begynneth a lytell boke<br>
called good manners.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>
<p>Again, before the end of the fifteenth century De
Worde had a series to illustrate <i>Reynard the Fox</i>. One
cut is found on the first leaf of an edition of Lidgate’s
<i>The Horse, the sheep, and the goose</i>, in the University
Library, another on the title-page of Skelton’s <i>Bowge of
Court</i> in the Advocates’ Library at Edinburgh. In the
collection of the University Librarian is a fragment of
an edition of <i>Reynard</i>, evidently printed by W. de Worde
about 1515, and this contains a third cut agreeing
absolutely in size, in workmanship, and in style with
the other two.</p>

<p>In this case again it seems probable that an edition
illustrated with these cuts appeared before 1500.</p>

<p>The last press at Westminster during the fifteenth
century is that of Julian Notary, which while it started
in London about 1496 and only moved to Westminster
in 1498, is more suitably taken in this place on account
of its connexion with Wynkyn de Worde.</p>

<p>The first book issued was an edition of <i>Albertus de
modis significandi</i>, printed in a neat Gothic type, but
containing no information in its colophon beyond that
it was printed in London at St Thomas the Apostle’s,
probably close to the church of that name, and not at a
house with that sign. There is also a printer’s mark
containing three sets of initials, I. N. for Julian Notary,
I. B. for Jean Barbier, and I. H. for someone unidentified,
but who there are some reasons for supposing to
have been Jean Huvin, a printer at Rouen, who was
associated in the production of books for the English
market.</p>

<p>In 1497 the same printers issued an edition of the
<i>Horae ad usum Sarum</i>, very neatly printed, and with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
delicate borders round the pages. All that remains of
the book is a fragment of four leaves, rescued from a
book-binding, but this luckily contains the colophon,
telling us that it was printed at St Thomas the
Apostle’s, for W. de Worde. This book also contains
the device with the three sets of initials.</p>

<p>In 1498 appeared a Sarum <i>Missal</i>, the first edition
printed in England, and though otherwise well got up,
the musical parts have the drawback of being without
notes, only the staves having been printed, though
whether this was done by design or merely because the
printers had no musical type remains unknown. From
the colophon of the <i>Missal</i> we learn that the printers,
Julian Notary and Jean Barbier, had settled at
Westminster, and had printed the book at the command
and expense of W. de Worde. On the last leaf is
Caxton’s device, and on the title-page that of the
printers. Of this book five copies are known, and of
the four I have examined, the copy in the University
Library is the only perfect one. About the fifth,
belonging to the Duke of Sutherland, I have no
information.</p>

<p>I. H. it is clear had left the firm, and though the
printers use the same device as before, the initials I. H.
have been cut out of it.</p>

<p>In 1499 Jean Barbier also disappeared, for in the
edition of the <i>Liber Festivalis</i> and <i>Quattuor Sermones</i>
which appeared in that year the printer’s mark has
again been altered. All initials have been cut out and
the name Julianus Notarii inserted in type. This form
of the name suggests that he was not a notary as is
generally stated, but the son of one. I have never been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
able to see a perfect copy of this book though Herbert
describes one which he said was in the Inner Temple
Library, but my inquiries there met with no success.
Hain in his <i>Repertorium Bibliographicum</i> mentions a
copy which seems not to be the one noticed by Herbert.</p>

<p>In April, 1500, Notary printed a most minute
edition of the <i>Horae ad usum Sarum</i>, it is in 64s as
regards folding, and a printed page measures an inch
and a quarter by an inch. Only a fragment of it is
known, a quarter sheet containing sixteen leaves, but
that luckily contains the colophon. It was very likely
copied from another edition of the same size, which was
printed at Paris the year before, but this point cannot
be determined, as the only copy of the latter which
existed was burnt with the greater part of the Offor
collection. All we know now of it is the meagre note
in the auctioneer’s catalogue, “imperfect, but has end
with imprint”—and he has not given the imprint!</p>

<p>The colophon of Notary’s <i>Horae</i> tells us that it was
printed in King Street, Westminster. King Street is
the short street at the bottom of Whitehall in a straight
line between Westminster Abbey and the Foreign
Office, though in Notary’s time it appears to have
extended from Westminster to Charing Cross. Lewis,
in his life of Caxton, says that Caxton’s printing-office
was in King Street, but I do not know of any reason
for his assertion.</p>

<p>The last of Notary’s books printed at Westminster
is an edition of Chaucer’s <i>Love and complaintes between
Mars and Venus</i>, with some other pieces. This rare
little book, having passed through the collections of
Farmer, the Duke of Roxburghe, Sir Mark Masterman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
Sykes and Heber, is now at Britwell. The colophon
runs: “Thys inpryntyde in westmoster in kyng strete.
For me Julianus Notarii.” In spite of the word For, I
think the book was printed by Julian Notary himself.
It contains two cuts, reversed copies of two of Caxton’s.</p>

<p>At what time Notary left Westminster cannot at
present be settled, but probably almost immediately
after W. de Worde. When his next dated book was
issued in 1503 he had moved to London, and with his
departure from King Street to Pynson’s old house near
Temple Bar printing ceased altogether in Westminster.</p>

<p class="c sp">THE PRINTERS AT LONDON.</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> art of printing was introduced into London in
1480, three years after Westminster, two years after
Oxford, and probably one year after St Alban’s, by a
printer called Joannes Lettou. The name evidently
denotes that he came originally from Lithuania, of
which the word Lettou is an old form. One thing is at
once apparent when we come to examine his work, and
that is that he was a skilled and practised printer,
producing books entirely unlike Caxton’s, and bearing
every appearance of being the work of a foreign press.
Where he learned to print it is impossible to find out,
but whence his type was obtained no one can have the
least doubt: it was certainly brought from Rome.</p>

<p>The type is identical with that used by a printer at
Rome in 1478 and 1479, who really ought to have some
connexion with English printing as his name was John
Bulle. In his Roman books he describes himself as
from Bremen. If it were possible to arrive at any
explanation how a man from Bremen could be described
as a Lithuanian, I should at once assume John Lettou<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
and John Bulle to be identical, since the one apparently
begins where the other leaves off. However, until some
reasonable explanation is forthcoming it will be best to
consider them as different people.</p>

<p>Lettou seems to have been assisted during the first
two years of his career by a certain William Wilcock,
but who this man may have been I have not been able
to discover, unless he was a certain William Wilcock
who is mentioned in the State Papers as having been
presented to the living of Llandussell in 1487. The
two books printed by Lettou were the <i>Questiones
Antonii Andreae super duodecim libros metaphisice</i> and
the <i>Expositiones super Psalterium</i> of Thomas Wallensis.
Both these books are printed in a neat small Italian
gothic, with two columns to the page and forty-nine or
fifty lines in a column. The first of the two books, the
<i>Antonius Andreae</i>, is a small folio of 106 leaves, and
almost all the six known copies are imperfect. The
book is very probably reprinted from the edition printed
at Vicenza in 1477, the only earlier edition than the
present, which, like it, is edited by Thomas Penketh.
Penketh was a friar of the Augustinian house at
Warrington, but went later as teacher of theology to
Padua. He returned to Oxford in 1477, where he also
taught theology, and was probably living there when
his book was being printed at London.</p>

<p>The second of these two books is printed in exactly
the same style and form as the first, with the exception
of having fifty lines to the column in place of forty-nine.
In the imprint the book is ascribed to the
“Reverendissimus dominus Valencius,” that is Jacobus
Perez de Valentia, who was, however, not the author of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
this work, though he did write a commentary on the
Psalms. The real author was a certain Thomas
Wallensis or de Walleis. Henry Bradshaw, who discovered
the mistake, gives the following explanation of
it: “This edition is printed from an incomplete copy,
and from the words of the colophon ‘Reverendissimi
domini Valencii,’ the final s having been misread as an
i, the work has been confounded with the commentary
of Jacobus Perez de Valencia, which was printed at that
place in 1484 and 1493. The v for w and the absence
of the Christian name would also serve to create the
confusion, or at any rate to perpetuate it.”</p>

<p>Three editions of the indulgence of John Kendale
were printed by Lettou in 1480. The first two have
been preserved in a very curious manner. It was a
common custom of the early binders to paste a thin strip
of vellum down the centre of each quire of paper in
order to prevent the thread which ran down the centre
of the quire and stitched it to the bands of the binding
from cutting through the paper. A copy of a foreign
printed Bible, which appears to have been bound in
England, perhaps by Lettou himself, and which is now
in the library of Jesus College, Cambridge, has the
centre of each quire throughout the book lined with a
strip of vellum, part of cut up copies of these two
indulgences. Indulgences having their year printed
upon them soon went out of date, and as they were of
vellum and printed only on one side were very much
used by bookbinders for lining bindings. These
two indulgences were issued early in the year and have
the date 1480, but no mention is made of the pontifical
year of the pope. The third indulgence, of which a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
copy is in the British Museum, also dated 1480, has
besides, the date of the pontifical year, “the year of our
pontificate the tenth,” and as the popes dated like the
kings, from the exact date of their accession or coronation,
this copy must have been printed after
August 7, 1480, on which date the tenth year of
Sixtus IV began.</p>

<p>After the printing of his two books and editions of
the indulgence, Lettou entered into partnership with a
printer called Wilhelmus de Machlinia, a native, as his
name shows, of Mechlin in Belgium. Together they
printed five books, the <i>Tenores Novelli</i> of Littelton, the
<i>Abridgement of the Statutes</i>, and the <i>Year-books</i> of the
thirty-third, thirty-fifth, and thirty-sixth years of
Henry VI.</p>

<p>For these books the printers used a small very
cramped black letter, abounding in abbreviations, and
often difficult to read. It appears to have been
designed after the law hand of the period. The edition
of the <i>Tenures</i> is the only one of these books with an
imprint, and it contains the names of both printers, and
the statement that the book was printed in the city of
London, “juxta ecclesiam omnium sanctorum.” There
were, however, several churches in London at this time
dedicated to All Saints, and it is not possible now to
settle which particular one was meant. Complete sets
of these five books are in the British Museum and the
Cambridge University Library.</p>

<p>The entire change in the character of the books
produced after Machlinia had joined Lettou shows that
his strong point was legal printing, and during his continuance
in business he seems to have printed all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
law-books issued in England. But perhaps the most
marked peculiarity of his partnership is the extraordinary
deterioration in the books produced. The
work of Lettou was marked by excellence of typography
and the many improvements introduced by an evidently
practised printer. As soon as Machlinia joined him
the work became slovenly. It might be supposed that
Mr William Wilcock, who had defrayed the expense of
Lettou’s work, had either tried it as a speculation and
found it a poor one, or had only wished the two books
to be specially printed for his own use and had then
left the printer to shift for himself. It is curious, too,
that Lettou’s neat type should have entirely disappeared.
The real reason for this probably was that though it
was very neat it had none of the abbreviations necessary
in a type used for printing law-books.</p>

<p>While Lettou remained in the firm the work,
though much deteriorated, retained a certain amount
of regularity. All the books had signatures and were
regular in size, though their appearance was not good.
After the issue of these five books Lettou seems to have
ceased printing, but the type was used for one more
book, which it will be well to notice here, <i>The History
of the Siege of Rhodes</i>. This was written in Latin by
Gulielmus Caorsin, vice-chancellor of the Knights of
Malta, and was translated into English by John Kay,
who styles himself poet-laureate to Edward IV. It gives
an account of the great victory of the Rhodians against
the Turks and the death of Mahomet.</p>

<p>It is the only early English printed book which we
cannot definitely ascribe to any particular printer. By
most early writers it was classed as a production of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
Caxton, and Dibdin places it under Caxton in his <i>Typographical
Antiquities</i>, though he there expresses a doubt
as to its being his work. “The typography,” he says, “is
so rude as to induce me to suppose that the book was not
printed by Caxton. The oblique dash for the comma
is very coarse; and the adoption of the colon and the
period, as well as the comparatively wide distances
between the lines, are circumstances which, as they are
not to be found in Caxton’s acknowledged publications,
strongly confirm this supposition.” Five years later,
writing in the <i>Bibliotheca Spenceriana</i>, he seems to have
settled more accurately. “I have very little doubt,” he
writes there, “of its having been executed by Lettou and
Machlinia, or by the former of these printers, rather
than by Caxton. The letters, however, great and small,
especially the larger ones, and some of the compound
smaller ones, bear a strong resemblance to the smallest
types of our first printer; but on a comparison with
those of the <i>Tenures</i> of Lyttelton and the <i>Ancient
Abridgement of the Statutes</i>, printed by Lettou and
Machlinia, the resemblance is quite complete.” The
type is certainly that used by Lettou and Machlinia,
and the considerable difference in appearance from the
other five books is caused by the text being in English,
which makes more difference than would be imagined,
and also that there are very few of the abbreviations
which crowd the other books. Then again the lines of
type are spaced out, giving the page a much lighter
appearance.</p>

<p>Though the dedication is to Edward IV, it does not
necessarily follow that the book was printed before his
death, for the early printers in reprinting a manuscript<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
would keep to the preface as there written. It might,
however, have been printed as early as 1483, and immediately
the law books had been completed. Who the
printer was I do not think can ever be settled. When
it was printed Machlinia had probably started by
himself with his new types, and I do not think it can
have been printed by Lettou, as it has not the signatures
to the pages which he invariably used.</p>

<p>We may, I think, date the break up of the partnership
of John Lettou and William de Machlinia about
1482-83, and from that date onwards Machlinia worked
alone. He seems to have made a fresh start with new
type, for he has at least three founts which had not
been used before. The difficulties in the way of making
any arrangement or arriving at any definite conclusions
about his books are very great. We know that he
printed at least twenty-two books, and not one single
one is dated. Signatures, directors, headlines, seem to
be present or absent without rule or reason. There is
hardly any method of arranging the books in groups,
every book stands alone in splendid isolation.</p>

<p>The only division possible is according to the type
used in the books, and in this way we can separate
them into two groups. Those of the first group are
printed in two founts of a square gothic type, and as in
colophons of the two books in this series which possess
them the printer speaks of himself as living near the
“Flete-bridge,” we call these books the ones printed in
the Fleet-bridge type. The other group are in a
regular English type, similar in general appearance to
some of Caxton’s or that used by the printer of St
Alban’s, and in the imprint to one of these books<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
Machlinia speaks of himself as printing in Holborn, so
that we speak of this series of books as printed in the
Holborn type. As Flete-bridge was at the east end of
Fleet Street and a considerable distance from Holborn
it is impossible that these two addresses could apply to
one office.</p>

<p>It is probable that the Fleet-bridge group is the
earlier, so we will take it first. In it there are
altogether eight books. Three folios, the <i>Tenures of
Lyttelton</i>, the <i>Nova Statuta</i>, and the <i>Promise of Matrimony</i>,
four quartos, the <i>Vulgaria Terentii</i>, the <i>Revelation
of St Nicholas to a Monk of Evesham</i>, and two books by
Albertus Magnus, the <i>Liber Aggregationis seu de secretis
naturae</i>, and the <i>Secreta mulierum</i>, and one small book,
probably a 16º, an edition of the <i>Horae ad usum
Sarum</i>.</p>

<p>The two books of Albertus Magnus are certainly
the most neatly printed, the press work being tidy and
regular, which was not generally the case with this
printer’s productions.</p>

<p>The copy of the <i>Secreta mulierum</i> in the University
Library is an interesting one, though, unfortunately,
imperfect. On the first leaf which is blank there is a
certain amount of writing, amongst other things the
following sentence: “Annus domini nunc est 1485 in
anno Ricardi tercii 3º.” This note, supposing it to have
been written at the time to which it refers, and there
is no reason to doubt it, must have been written
between June 26 and August 22, 1485, showing that at
any rate the book was printed before that date. The
other book of Albertus Magnus, the <i>Liber aggregationis</i>,
has a colophon stating that it was printed by “William<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
de Machlinia in the most wealthy city of London, near
the bridge vulgarly called the Flete-bridge.” The
wealth of London seems to have impressed the alien
printer, for he always applies the word “<i>opulentissima</i>”
to that city.</p>

<p>The small <i>Horae</i> we have little information about,
for we know of its existence only from nineteen leaves
scattered about the country. There are eight in Corpus
Christi College, Oxford, seven in the British Museum,
four in Lincoln Minster, and two in the University
Library, Cambridge. These have all been extracted
from bindings, and in the cases where we know the
particular bindings from which they came these bindings
were the work of the same man, whose initials
were W. G. From the way in which the leaves were
printed, and the way in which they were afterwards
folded, a point too technical and difficult of description
to touch on here, we may pretty safely say that the
<i>Horae</i> was a 16º and not an 8º. It may be worth
while remarking that the early printers used only the
simple folding, which with each successive folding
exactly halves the size of the previous one. The sheet
folded into two leaves produced folio size, this folded
again once made 4to, folded again 8º, again 16º, again
32º, and again 64º. The duodecimo or 12º, which
depends on more complicated folding, was quite unknown.</p>

<p>The <i>Horae</i>, so far as we can see from what remains,
contained no illustrations, but it had an engraved border
which was used round the pages beginning certain
portions of the book. This engraved border we afterwards
find in Pynson’s hands, and it is the only definite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
link connecting him with this press. Bradshaw, in his
paper on the “Image of Pity,” suggests that Ames, who
quoted this book in his <i>Typographical Antiquities</i>, had
seen a complete copy, but as he describes it merely as
“a book of devotions on vellum” and adds no particulars
I think that he simply described it from the few
leaves in his own possession, which are now in the
British Museum in the great so-called Bagford volumes
of despoiled title-pages.</p>

<p>The <i>Revelation of St Nicholas to a Monk of Evesham</i>
is one of the most remarkable volumes of the fifteenth
century, very well worth reading, for it is full of early
English stories and allusions. (I may say in passing
that Mr Arber has issued a cheap reprint of it.) The
story tells of a man who was taken through purgatory
and was shown various people whom he had known or
heard of and listened to their stories. It seems to me
very curious that no other editions of the book were
issued in early times: it seems exactly the kind of book
which must have been popular. Typographically, the
book is interesting as showing an excellent example of
wrong imposition, that is that when the one side of the
sheet had been printed, the other side was put down
upon its form of type the wrong way round, and consequently
the pages come all in their wrong order, page 1
being printed on the first side of the first leaf, page 14
follows it on the other side, then page 16, then page 4,
and so on. Now, most printers who had done this
stupid thing, and it was not an uncommon accident,
would have destroyed the sheet and reprinted it. Not
so Machlinia. He printed off some more copies of the
wrong sheet and, cutting it up, pasted the four pages in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
their proper places. In one of the two known copies
this has had unfortunate results, for some curious
inquirer, noticing the pages pasted together, has tried
to separate them to find out what was underneath, and
they have suffered severely in the process.</p>

<p>The <i>Vulgaria Terentii</i> is the last of the quartos in
this group. It is a book that was often printed, but of
the present edition the copy in the University Library
is the only one remaining, and it, unfortunately, is
slightly imperfect.</p>

<p>Of the folios, the <i>Nova Statuta</i> is the most important,
and also by far the commonest, for I have examined
over a dozen copies myself, and I know of a good many
more. The book must have been printed after April,
1483, as the subject-matter runs up to that date, while
an action in Chancery relating to it was tried between
1483 and 1485. The <i>Promise of Matrimony</i>, another
folio in this type, consisting only of four leaves, relates
to the agreement made in 1475 between Edward IV
and Louis XI for the marriage of the Princess Elizabeth
of York and Prince Charles, afterwards Charles VIII,
King of France.</p>

<p>I have noticed that in nearly all the copies of
the law-books printed by Lettou and Machlinia, or
Machlinia alone, that I have examined, the initial
letters, which were filled in by hand in colour, appear
to have been done by the same person; the letter
roughly in red, and a twirl or two by way of ornament
in pale green or blue. I suppose the subject of the
books was so severely practical that unless this had
been done before the book left the office it would never
have been done at all. However, in English printing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
generally, though the spaces were left for fine initials, I
can remember very few books with them filled in in
any but the plainest way, a contrast to the beautiful
work so often found in Italian books.</p>

<p>The last group of books, which number fourteen, are
called the Holbom type books, because, in the imprint
of one of the two books that contain them we find the
words, “Enprente per moy william Maclyn en Holborn.”
The general type used for the text of these books is
very remarkably like that used by Veldener at Utrecht
and by John Brito at Bruges, and may, perhaps, have
been obtained by Machlinia from abroad, though it is
of the same school of type as several used in England.</p>

<p>The most important book issued in this series is an
edition of the <i>Chronicles of England</i>. It is a very rare
book, but there is an imperfect copy in Cambridge in
the Barham collection in Pembroke College. The space
for the initial letters, as is usually the case with early
books, has been left blank to be filled in by the
rubricator, but in one copy that I have seen, the initials
have been filled in in gold, not gold leaf, but gold paint,
and this is the only example of its use that I have
found in an early English book. Another curious point
about the book is that though it is a folio, a folio of
238 leaves, yet in all copies leaves 59 and 66, the first
and last leaves of a quire, are printed on quarto paper.
I thought once that perhaps for some reason these
leaves had been cancelled and reprinted, but it seems
more probable that the printer had for the moment run
out of his supply of ordinary-sized paper, and had to
use some of a much larger size cut in half. A similar
case of mixed papers is found in the <i>Nova Rhetorica</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
printed at St Albans in 1480, which is partly quarto
and partly octavo.</p>

<p>Three editions were published by Machlinia of the
curious <i>Treatise of the Pestilence</i> by Canutus or Kamitus,
Bishop of Westeraes in Sweden, and of each edition
only one copy is known, one in the British Museum,
one in the University Library, and one sold lately in the
sale of the Ashbumham Library and now at Manchester.
I must warn anyone who uses Dibdin’s <i>Typographical
Antiquities</i>, that the facsimile page of the book which
he gives is made up from the upper part of the first
leaf of the Cambridge copy and the lower part of the
same leaf of the Manchester copy, which he must have
seen when it was in the possession of Triphook, the
bookseller, so that the resulting facsimile is rather
puzzling. The fact that one of these editions, that in
the British Museum, has a title-page, makes us inclined
to put it to rather a late date, but at any rate it is the
earliest title-page in an English printed book.</p>

<p>Another book in this group, by far the commonest
and best known, is the <i>Speculum Christiani</i>, ascribed to
a writer named John Watton, a curious medley of theological
matter interspersed with pieces of English
poetry. The colophon states that the book was printed
for and at the expense of a merchant named Henry
Vrankenbergh. About this merchant I could find out
nothing until, curiously enough, on my last visit to
Cambridge a fortnight ago, my attention was drawn by
a friend to a note in the Descriptive Catalogue of
ancient deeds in the Record Office, where is a note of a
“Demise to Henry Frankenbergk and Barnard van
Stondo, merchants of printed books, of an alley in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
St Clement’s Lane, called St Mark’s Alley, 10th May,
1482.”</p>

<p>This is, I believe, the earliest note relating to foreign
stationers or merchants of printed books in England,
but I hope from the same source we may expect to
obtain many more as soon as the endless series of documents
in the Record Office are calendared.</p>

<p>An edition of the <i>Vulgaria Terentii</i> was also printed
in this type. An almost perfect copy was added to the
British Museum Library some years ago, and a considerable
portion of another copy is in the library of
Caius College.</p>

<p>Machlinia also printed two of the <i>Nova Festa</i>, the
<i>Festum visitationis beate Marie virginis</i> and the <i>Festum
transfigurationis Jesu Christi</i>. The first of these is
only known from two leaves which had been used to
line the boards of the binding of Pynson’s <i>Dives and
Pauper</i>. Of the second a beautiful and perfect copy is
in the library of the Marquis of Bath. It is curious to
notice that it contains not only the feast according to
the Sarum use, but also according to the Roman use.</p>

<p>The last three of Machlinia’s books to be noticed
are the three which, though undated themselves,
contain certain evidences of date. The first of these
contains the statutes made in the first year of
Richard III, and, as this first year ran from June 26,
1483, to June 25, 1484, the book cannot be earlier
than the second half of the latter year.</p>

<p>The second book is one about which I am very
much inclined to doubt whether it was printed by
Machlinia at all, but rather by Veldener, who used
apparently identical type; and though I have had for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
several years under my charge at Manchester the only
copy of the book known I cannot make up my mind
about it. It is an edition of the <i>Regulae et ordinationes</i>
of Innocent VIII, and could not at any rate have been
printed before the very end of 1484. The type seems
newer in appearance than any of Machlinia’s, though to
all appearance identical. Dibdin, with his usual
readiness, helps us by remarking, “It presents us
with the same character or general appearance of type
as that which Caxton and Machlinia occasionally used.
It is not much unlike the St Alban’s type.”</p>

<p>The last production is a Bull of Innocent VIII
confirming the marriage of Henry VII and Elizabeth
of York. It was reissued in 1494 by Alexander VI,
and there the date is given as 27th March, 1486.</p>

<p>Two copies of this Bull are known, one in the library
of the Society of Antiquaries and one in the Rylands
Library, Manchester. Both are in poor condition, and
show signs of having been used at one time to line the
boards of a binding.</p>

<p>Richard Pynson was by birth a native of Normandy,
but practically nothing is known of his personal history.
It is probable that he was educated at the University
of Paris, for we find in a list of students in 1464 the
name “Ricardus Pynson Normannus,” and this may
very well be the printer. It was, however, in Normandy
that he learned to print, probably from Guillaume le
Talleur, a noted printer of Rouen, as may be seen by
certain small habits connected with printing which
he fell into, and which are very typical of Rouen
work. Although we have only circumstantial evidence,
evidence depending on a number of almost trifling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
details to back up the statement, it seems now almost
certain that Pynson succeeded Machlinia. My own
impression is that he succeeded immediately on the
death or retirement of the latter, with hardly any
interval. A very strong reason for this impression is
that had any long time elapsed between the cessation
of Machlinia’s press and the commencement of Pynson’s,
England would have been left without a printer who
could set up law French. Caxton and Wynkyn de
Worde were presumably unable to do it, at any rate
they printed no books of the kind except some statutes
of Henry VII, and it must be remembered that in
Henry VII’s reign for the first time the statutes were
written in English. I do not mean to suggest that
Pynson ever worked with Machlinia, but only that
when the latter ceased to work Pynson came over and
started in his place, perhaps taking over some of his
printing material or even starting work in his old office.
The engraved border which Machlinia had used in his
Sarum <i>Horae</i>, the only piece of ornament he seems to
have possessed, we find used afterwards by Pynson, and
it is a very common thing to find Pynson’s earliest
bindings lined with waste leaves of Machlinia’s printing.
Had Pynson worked with Machlinia we should have
expected the latter’s founts of type to have passed into
his hands, as Caxton’s were inherited by Wynkyn de
Worde, but they did not. Indeed they totally disappeared,
and what we do find of Machlinia’s in Pynson’s
hands is merely the refuse that we might expect a
printer to find in an office just vacated by another.
Had Pynson not been ready to take over the place this
waste stuff would have been destroyed. The question
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>is, then, when did Machlinia cease or Pynson begin?
I should say that Machlinia ceased much later than is
supposed and Pynson began much earlier, and that the
two events happened between 1488 and 1490. At first
when Pynson arrived he was without material, so he
commissioned Le Talleur at Rouen to print for him
the two law-books most in demand, <i>Littelton’s Tenures</i>
and <i>Statham’s Abridgement of Cases to the end of
Henry VI</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f3">
<img src="images/fig3.jpg" alt="impressa">
</div>

<p>Probably in 1490-1491 he began printing on his
own account. His first dated book was issued in
November, 1492, but five books, if not more, can be
placed earlier; these are an edition of Chaucer’s
<i>Canterbury Tales</i>, a <i>Latin Grammar</i>, a poetical book,
and two or more <i>Year-books</i>. The <i>Chaucer</i> is a
particularly fine book, printed in two sizes of type,
a larger for the poetry, and a smaller for the prose,
which is printed in two columns. It is also illustrated
with a set of woodcuts illustrating the different pilgrims.
It is interesting to notice that these cuts were altered
in some cases while the book was passing through the
press in order to serve as the portrait of another
pilgrim. The serjeaunt with a little alteration becomes
the doctor of physick, the squire becomes the manciple.
There has been a good deal of controversy as to the
date of the printing of this book and whether it could
have appeared before Caxton’s death in the latter part
of the year 1491. Pynson in his prologue, which is
rather confused and difficult to understand, says, speaking
of Chaucer: “Of whom I among alle other of his
bokes, the boke of the tales of Canterburie, in whiche
ben many a noble historie of wisdome policie mirth and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
gentilnes. And also of vertue and holynes whiche
boke diligently ovirsen and duely examined by the
pollitike reason and ouirsight of my worshipful master
William Caxton accordinge to the entent and effecte of
the seide Geffrey Chaucer and by a copy of the seid
master Caxton purpos to imprent, by ye grace, ayde,
and supporte of almighty god.” I think had Caxton
been dead Pynson would have alluded to it in some
way, speaking of him, perhaps, as “my late worshipful
master” or “my worshipful master late dead.” The
term worshipful master does not imply that Pynson
had been an apprentice or assistant to Caxton, but was
merely a courteous way of referring to the printer and
editor whose work he was about to reprint. Blades in
his life of Caxton, speaks of Pynson’s having used
Caxton’s device, but this mistake has arisen through a
made-up book in the British Museum, a copy of
Bonaventure’s <i>Speculum vite Christi</i>. The copy wanted
the end, and some former owner, in order to make the
book look more complete, has added a leaf with Caxton’s
device printed on it.</p>

<p>The <i>Latin Grammar</i> is known only from three
leaves, one in the Bodleian and two in the British
Museum. The leaf in the Bodleian appears from an
inscription upon it to have been used to line a binding
as early as 1494. The book was printed entirely in
the large black type of the <i>Chaucer</i>, the first of Pynson’s
types, and which he does not appear to have used
after 1492.</p>

<p>Another book printed about this time was a book
of poetry of a quarto size. All that is at present known
of this book are two little strips making part of a leaf,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
and each containing six lines of verse, three on each side.
I found these fragments a year or two ago amongst
a bundle of uncatalogued leaves in the Bodleian,
but was not able at the time to determine from what
book they came. The story is apparently of someone
who having been in purgatory is allowed to revisit the
world in order to warn others of what he had seen
there. This was a common story, and the occurrence
of part of a line “But y the goste of guido” makes it
certain that the fragments belong to some version of a
work called <i>Spiritus Guidonis</i>.</p>

<p>The two other books in this series are two year-books,
for the first and ninth years of Edward IV. All
these early books, with the exception, of course, of the
poetry fragments, contain Pynson’s first device, which
consists of his monogram in white upon a black background,
not at all unlike in style that used by Le
Talleur at Rouen, with whom he had been associated.
When the device was used in November, 1492, a small
alteration had been made in it, so that from the state
of the device as well as by the type used we are able to
settle which books belong to this earliest group.</p>

<p>In 1492 Pynson’s first dated book appeared, an
edition of the <i>Doctrinal</i> of Alexander Grammaticus,
editions of which had already been printed abroad in
considerable numbers. Pynson’s was not copied from
any of these, having a different commentary, but who
this commentary is by I have not yet been able to
ascertain.</p>

<p>This book was only discovered quite lately, and I
came upon it by a fortunate accident. The owner, or
rather guardian, of it happened to have read in some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
book that the earliest dated book of Pynson’s was issued
in 1493. Knowing that he had an earlier one he wrote
to the British Museum about it, and I heard casually
that the book had been sent to them to examine. I
went up to London immediately to see if I could see
the book, but was told it had been returned, nor could
I obtain any information as to where it was to be
found. Luckily, the owner was so far interested as to
write a note to one of the papers mentioning the existence
of the book, and also the place where it was
preserved—the Grammar School at Appleby. The
following Saturday I set off to Appleby, and had the
pleasure of examining it at my leisure. It is a beautiful
copy, quite perfect, in its original binding, and, as one
would have hoped, with end leaves taken from
Machlinia’s <i>Chronicle</i>. It has a perfectly clear Latin
imprint which runs: “And thus ends the commentary
of the Doctrinale of Alexander, printed by me Richard
Pynson of the parish of St Clement Danes outside the
bar of the new Temple at London the 13th day of the
month of November in the year of the incarnation of
our Lord 1492.” From this colophon it is clear that if
Pynson did commence work in Machlinia’s old office,
which was in Holborn, he had by this time removed to
other premises. The commentary in the book is
printed in a very small, neat type which Pynson had
probably had made for him abroad, as it contained no
w. I am sorry that the discovery of this book has
thrown out of order the list of Pynson’s types which I
gave in the introduction to my <i>Facsimiles of Early
English Printing</i>. In 1903 this volume was sold by
the school trustees, and is now in the British Museum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>In 1493 appeared Henry Parker’s <i>Dialogue of Dives
and Pauper</i>, which was always considered, before the
discovery of the <i>Doctrinale</i>, Pynson’s first dated book.
It is printed in a new and handsome type, and this is
the only dated book in which it is used, though there are
four undated quartos in the same type, which may be
put down to the same year. These are the <i>Festum
nominis Jesu</i>, one of the <i>Nova Festa</i> printed as supplements
to the Sarum <i>Breviary</i>, the <i>Life of St Margaret</i>,
Lidgate’s <i>Churl and Birde</i>, and an edition apparently
of some statutes or a similar work known from two
leaves in the library at Lambeth. Of the <i>Festum
nominis Jesu</i> one copy is known, bound up in a volume
with several other tracts, among them being Caxton’s
<i>Festum transfigurationis Jesu Christi</i>. It was for a
while in the Congregational Library in London but
was eventually sold to the British Museum. Three
printed leaves from the beginning of the poem amongst
the fragments in the Bodleian are all that remain of the
<i>Life of St Margaret</i>. The Lidgate’s <i>Churl and Birde</i>
after passing through the sales of Willett, the Marquis
of Blandford, Sir F. Freeling and B. H. Bright, passed
with the Grenville Library into the British Museum.</p>

<p>Two editions of Mirk’s <i>Liber Festivalis</i>, each known
from a single copy, one in the Pepysian Library, the
other in the University Library, belong probably to
this time. The various changes in the book are
interesting to trace. In the earliest editions there are
no references to, or additional chapters for, the new
feasts which were then coming into use; then come
editions with the extra feasts printed together at the
end as a kind of supplement to the book, and finally we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
get the editions with these extra feasts put into their
proper places in the body of the book. The edition in
the Pepysian Library is without these extra feasts,
while that in the University Library has them as a
supplement of ten leaves at the end. In the next
edition, which was printed about the end of 1493 by
W. de Worde, the feasts have been incorporated into
their proper places.</p>

<p>In 1494 Pynson reverted to his earlier types and
issued a translation by Lidgate from Boccaccio called
the <i>Falle of Princes</i>, remarkable for its charming woodcuts.
In this book, for the first time, Pynson used his
second device, a large woodcut containing his initials
on a black shield with a helmet above on which is
perched a small bird. This I imagine is meant for a
finch, a punning allusion to his name, since pynson is
the Norman name for a finch. Round the whole is a
border of flowering branches, in which are birds and
grotesque beasts. This device supplies us later with a
most useful date test, for the edge split in 1496 and the
piece broke off entirely towards the end of 1497. After
1498 the use of this device was discontinued but it was
not destroyed, and it made a solitary reappearance, in a
sadly mutilated state in an edition of a grammar of
Whitinton in 1515. Probably in this year (1494)
Pynson issued his edition of the <i>Speculum vitae Christi</i>,
of which an almost perfect copy is in King’s library.
It is illustrated with a large number of neat woodcuts,
which are copied more or less from Caxton’s illustrations
to the same book, though they are by no means
identical with them, as has been often stated. As a
general rule Pynson’s cuts are of very much better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
execution and design than either Caxton’s or De
Worde’s, and though not in all cases good, as for
instance in the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, yet they never sink
to the very bad drawing and engraving so often found
in the works of the other two printers.</p>

<p>An edition of the <i>Hecyra</i> of Terence bears the date
January 20, 1495, but no other dated book of this year
is known, and 1496 was hardly better, having only the
two grammars, the <i>Liber Synonymorum</i> and <i>Liber
Equivocorum</i>, the latter usually wrongly attributed to
Joannes de Garlandia; but many undated books of very
considerable interest appeared about this time. Two of
these, the <i>Epitaph of Jasper</i>, <i>Duke of Bedford</i>, and the
<i>Foundation of Our Lady’s Chapel at Walsingham</i> are to
be found in the Pepysian Library. Jasper Tudor,
Duke of Bedford, and half-brother of Henry VI, died
on December 21, 1495, and the book must have been
printed early in 1496. It is ostensibly written by one
Smarte, the keeper of the hawks to the Duke, and
begins as follows:—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>


<p>The end runs:—</p>

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>This poem has been attributed to Skelton, though I
do not know for what reason. On the title-page is a
special cut, not used elsewhere, of Smarte kneeling,
with his hawk on his wrist, and presenting with his
other hand a book to a person standing. The
<i>Foundation of Our Lady’s Chapel at Walsingham</i> is
a small tract relating to the priory of the Augustinian
canons of St Mary, once one of the most important places
of pilgrimage in England, and which was described by
Erasmus. The first leaf, which would have contained
the title, is wanting, but the text begins on the
second:—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Of this chapell se here the fundacyon</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The tyme of Sent Edward kyng of this region.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>About this time appeared the first English edition
of <i>Mandeviles Travels</i>, the only edition, I think, issued
without illustrations, and a little reprint of Caxton’s
<i>Art and Craft to Know Well to Die</i>, of which the only
known copy, formerly Ratcliffe’s, is in the Hunterian
Museum at Glasgow.</p>

<p>Another poetical tract is the <i>Life of Petronylla</i>,
beginning:—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The parfite lyfe to put in remembraunce</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Called Petronylla petyrs doughter dere.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>This little tract consists of four leaves, and though
only three copies are known at present it is probable
that more are in existence, for the book seems to occur
in all the sales of large libraries which have occurred
within the last hundred years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>About 1496 Henry Quentell, a Cologne printer, had
issued the first edition of the <i>Expositio Hymnorum et
Sequentiarum</i>, according to the use of Sarum, but it
was found that several hymns and sequences were
omitted, so Pynson issued two supplements, one of
sixteen leaves to the hymns, another of six to the
sequences.</p>

<p>Another rather quaint book issued about this time
is a kind of vocabulary or phrase book in English and
French. “Here is a good book to lerne to speak french,
Vecy ung bon liure a apprendre a parler fraunchoys.”
The book contains also specimens of letters in French
relating to trade, in fact it was evidently intended as a
manual for people who had business relations with
France.</p>

<p>Two more editions of the <i>Nova Festa</i>, the <i>Festum
transfigurationis</i> and the <i>Festum nominis Jesu</i> were
issued about this time. The only copies known of
these two books are in a private library in Somerset,
and I have not yet had an opportunity of examining
them.</p>

<p>In 1497, or perhaps slightly earlier, Pynson began
to use his third device, made probably to take the place
of the second which had split, and taking warning from
it he had the new one cut in metal. The device
consists of the shield and monogram supported by a
man and a woman, with the helmet and bird above.
The border, which is cut on a separate piece, contains
birds and foliage, with the Virgin and Child and a
saint in the bottom corners. In the lowest part of the
frame a piece in the form of a ribbon has been cut out
for the insertion of type. In consequence of the weakness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
of that particular place the small piece of border
below the ribbon began to be pushed inwards, and by
1499 there was a distinct indentation in the border.
This got deeper and deeper year by year, until the
piece broke off entirely in 1513. The first dated book
in which it occurs is the 1497 edition of Alcock’s <i>Mons
perfectionis</i>, but it occurs in several of the undated
books that can be placed about 1496.</p>

<p>Between 1495 and the end of 1497 Pynson issued
the plays of Terence, the first classic (with the exception
of an Oxford edition of the <i>Pro Milone</i>, which is known
from a few leaves) that had been printed in England.
The six plays were evidently issued separately and not
as a volume, for they differ considerably typographically.
There is some difficulty, too, in determining in what
order they were issued.</p>

<p>In 1498 there are seven dated books, one of them
being the sermon of Bishop Alcock called <i>Gallicantus</i>,
and he is so pleased with jesting on his name that
he prefaces the text of his sermon with a little black
picture of a cockerel, which he also used as a device.
Another edition of the <i>Doctrinale</i> of Alexander the
Grammarian was issued this year, but I have not yet
seen the book, as the only copy known belongs to
Lord Beauchamp.</p>

<p>In 1499 a very interesting book was printed by
Pynson. This was the <i>Promptorius Puerorum</i>, a Latin-English
dictionary ascribed to a monk of Lynn. The
imprint tells us that the book was printed for Frederick
Egmondt and Peter post pascha. Frederick Egmondt
was an important stationer, and no doubt Peter post
pascha was a stationer also, though what name in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
vernacular can be represented by post pascha remains
an unsolved riddle. Mr Albert Way, in his edition of
the <i>Promptorium parvulorum</i>, applies a curious amount
of misplaced ingenuity to the question of the identity
of these two stationers. “We find about the time in
question,” he says, speaking of the name Egmondt,
“a distinguished person of that family, possibly the
patron of Pynson, Frederic, son of William IV, Count
of Egmond. In 1472 he received from his uncle, the
Duke of Gueldres, the lordship of Buren; he was named
governor of Utrecht by the Archduke Maximilian in
1492; two years later Buren was raised to a count in
reward of his services. There was a Peter, an illegitimate
brother of his father, who might have been living
at that time; what was his surname does not appear.”
Another book printed about this year was the <i>Elegantiarum
viginti praecepta</i>, a book which I am fond of for
a peculiar reason. I found once a leaf of it in the Signet
Library, Edinburgh, and, not knowing that any copy
was in existence, set to work to reconstruct the book
from the leaf. I counted the lines, and comparing with
foreign editions, conjectured the size and structure of
the book, and knowing how Pynson would make a title-page
with a woodcut, and the woodcut he would
probably use, I made up a description of the book,
taking the title from an early bibliography. At last I
heard of a perfect copy in a private library which the
owner was kind enough to allow me to examine.
When the book arrived I found I had not only got the
collation right, but by a lucky inspiration had selected
the correct woodcut for the title-page. As it happens
I might have spared myself the trouble, for I found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
afterwards a fairly accurate collation of the book in an
authority I had not consulted.</p>

<p>A curious prognostication for 1499 is in the
Bodleian. It is addressed to Henry VII, and was
drawn out by a William Parron, who lived at Piacenza
and called himself doctor of medicine and professor of
astrology. Another prognostication for 1502, by the
same author, was printed by Pynson, and some fragments
are in the library of Westminster Abbey. He
also wrote an astrological work on Henry, Duke of
York, afterwards Henry VIII, in 1502, of which there
are manuscripts in the British Museum and Bibliothèque
Nationale, but it does not seem ever to have
been printed.</p>

<p>The <i>Missal</i> which Pynson printed in 1500 is
perhaps the finest book printed in the fifteenth century
in England. It was produced at the expense of
Cardinal Morton, whose arms appear at the beginning,
and Pynson has introduced into the borders and initials
a rebus on the name consisting of the letters Mor
surmounting a barrel or tun. Five copies of this book
are known, three being on vellum. One of the latter
copies, slightly imperfect, is in the library of Trinity
College, Cambridge. In the copy at Manchester all the
references to St Thomas and his service, which had
been scraped out and erased according to the command
of Henry VIII, have been entirely filled in by some
pious seventeenth century owner in gold.</p>

<p>In the imprint, after setting forth that the book
was printed at the command of Cardinal Morton, Pynson
adds the date, January 10, 1500. Now, as Cardinal
Morton died on September 15, 1500, I think we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
here a strong piece of evidence that Pynson, like De
Worde, began his year on January 1. For if he had
begun it on March 25, then January 10, 1500, would
be after the Cardinal was dead, and Pynson would
surely have spoken of him as lately dead, or in some
way alluded to the loss of his patron.</p>

<p>The <i>Book of Cookery</i>, belonging to the Marquis of
Bath, was also printed this year. It begins: “Here
beginneth a noble boke of festes royalle and cokery,
a boke for a pryncis housholde or any other estates,
and the makynge therof accordynge as ye shall fynde
more playnly within this boke.” Then follows an
account of certain great banquets, the feast at the
coronation of Henry V; “the earle of Warwick’s feast
to the king, the feast of my lorde chancellor archbishop
of York at his stallacion in York,” and so on.
After the account of the feasts comes the more practical
Calendar of Cookery.</p>

<p>Two editions of the <i>Informatio Puerorum</i>, a small
grammatical work founded upon the <i>Donatus</i>, were
issued about this time. In the colophon of one it is
stated that the book was printed for George Chasteleyn
and John Bars. I have found no reference anywhere
to John Bars, but George Chasteleyn was an Oxford
bookseller, carrying on business at the Sign of St John
the evangelist in that city. It was for him also that in
1506 Pynson printed an edition of the <i>Principia</i> of
Peregrinus de Lugo. About this time there was no
press in Oxford, so that books for use in the schools had
to be printed in London.</p>

<p>In a scrap-book in the British Museum are some
leaves of an edition of the romance of <i>Guy of Warwick</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
which may be ascribed to Pynson, and they are printed
in a curious mixture of his early types. These leaves
were discovered in 1860 in the binding of a copy of
Maydeston’s <i>Directorium Sacerdotum</i>, printed by Pynson
in 1501, and an account of them was sent by their
discoverer, who signs himself E. F. B., to <i>Notes and
Queries</i>. Now, of this edition of the <i>Directorium</i>, only
two copies are known, one in the British Museum and
one in Ripon Cathedral, and I should very much like
to know from which copy these leaves were obtained.</p>

<p>During all the period from 1490 to 1500 Pynson
was busy issuing editions of law-books, more than a
quarter of his productions being of this class, and it is
probable that a considerable number more printed in
the fifteenth century may yet be discovered. They are
not of a nature to attract much interest, and are
generally very badly catalogued, or catalogued in
collections and not separately, and in one great English
library at least they have no more detailed press mark
than Law Room, so it is needless to say I have not yet
examined such books as they may have in that library.</p>

<p>Though he did not print so many books as De
Worde in the fifteenth century, nevertheless Pynson
was evidently a more enterprising and careful printer.
He had seven distinct founts of type, all of which were
made for him and not inherited from other printers,
and the works he produced were of a much more
scholarly nature, though this becomes more apparent
in his work during the sixteenth century. His patrons
were often learned and distinguished men, for whom he
produced such splendid work as the <i>Morton Missal</i>, and
he became later the recognised king’s printer. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
fifteenth century he printed altogether eighty-eight
books known to us.</p>

<p>Pynson, like De Worde, very considerately moved
to a new address at the end of the century; previous to
1501 he was in St Clement’s parish, outside Temple
Bar, which was the limit, I think, of the parish, but
afterwards moved inside Temple Bar, where he carried
on business at the Sign of the George. The colophon
to the <i>Book of Cookery</i>, printed in 1500, says, “Imprinted
without Temple Bar”; the colophon to the <i>Directorium
Sacerdotum</i> of 1501 says, “intra barram novi templi,”
so that the date is pretty accurately fixed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap large">In</span> speaking of the history of the printed book in
the fifteenth century I have so far dealt only with the
printers of London and Westminster; to-day I propose
to touch on the books printed abroad for the English
market and the stationers who sold them. In the early
days the different businesses of a publisher, a bookseller,
and a bookbinder were often carried on by one
man, who was called a stationer. He bought books
wholesale, sometimes having whole editions specially
printed for him, he bound them, and then sold them
like an ordinary bookseller. He also probably in
England, as was certainly done on the Continent, sent
round vans full of books to the various provincial towns,
timing his arrival as far as possible to coincide with the
local fairs.</p>

<p>A considerable number of the books printed abroad
for sale in England have no connexion with any particular
stationer, but were probably brought over by an
agent of the printer and sold in lots to different
stationers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>The earliest book printed abroad definitely for sale
in England is the edition of the Sarum <i>Breviary</i> printed
at Cologne about 1475. Of this book nothing is left
but a few leaves, and the imprint, if it possessed one, is
not known. Only one other book is known printed in
the same type, an edition of the <i>Homilies</i>, but it,
unfortunately, has no imprint, so that we have no clue
as to who may have been the printer. I cannot help
thinking that perhaps Caxton may have had something
to do with having this book printed, commissioning it
either on his own account or for some friend in England,
for it is unlikely that a printer in so distant a town
would have issued such a book on his own account, and
the probable date of its printing coincides more or less
with Caxton’s departure for England.</p>

<p>In 1483 a book was printed at Venice for sale in
England, curiously enough another edition of the Sarum
<i>Breviary</i>. The copy in the Bibliothèque Nationale, the
only one known, is a very beautiful book, printed on
vellum and quite perfect. There is a rather painful
history attached to it. In 1715 this unique book came
to the University Library, Cambridge, as part of the
library of Bishop Moore which was presented to the
University by George I. In the latter half of the
eighteenth century it appears to have been purloined
along with a great many other rarities by a certain Dr
Combe. It then found its way into the collection of
Count Justin MacCarthy, who formed the largest library
of books printed on vellum ever brought together by a
private collector (he had over 600 of such books), and
at his sale in 1815 it was purchased for the Paris
Library for fifty-one francs. The printer of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
book, Reginaldus de Novimagio, does not appear to
have had any connexion with England, nor does the
imprint mention for whom the book was produced. It
is curious that he should have been chosen as the
printer of this <i>Breviary</i>, for it seems to have been the
only liturgical work he issued, and nothing among his
other productions has any connexion with England.
Of course English people passed through Venice in
large quantities as it was the starting-point for pilgrims
to the Holy Land, and many ecclesiastics of high
position went on this journey, so that perhaps one of
these travellers, seeing the beautiful work done at
Venice, and knowing that no printer at home was equal
to the task of producing such a book in a fitting
manner, commissioned the printing of the <i>Breviary</i>.
It is sad to think that so beautiful a book has been lost
to England through the dishonesty of a reader in the
Library. We can only regret that the negotiations
between the Duke of Devonshire and the representatives
of Count MacCarthy for the purchase of the library <i>en
bloc</i> fell through, and that the Duke and Lord Spencer,
who both bought considerably at the sale, did not
secure it, for then at any rate it might have been in
England, though not in its proper place.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f4">
<img src="images/fig4.jpg" alt="latin">
</div>

<p>In the year 1484 some important Acts were passed
relating to the trading of foreigners in this country.
The ninth chapter ends: “Provided always that this
act or any parcel thereof, or any other act made, or to
be made in this said parliament, shall not extend, or be
in prejudice, disturbance, damage, or impediment, to
any artificer, or merchant stranger, of what nation or
country he be, or shall be of, for bringing into this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>realm, or selling by retail, or otherwise, any books
written or printed, or for inhabiting within this said
realm for the same intent, or any scrivener, alluminor,
binder or printer of such books, which he hath, or shall
have to sell by way of merchandise, or for their dwelling
within this said realm, for the exercise of the said
occupations; this act or any part thereof notwithstanding.”</p>

<p>This Act it will be seen, which was not repealed
until 1534, gave absolute liberty to foreign printers and
stationers to trade and reside in England. That it
succeeded in its object of encouraging the immigration
of stationers and craftsmen and the importation of
books, is clear from the words of the Act of 1534:
“Whereas by the provision of a Statute made in the
firste yere of the reygne of Kynge Richarde the thirde,
it was provided in the same acte that all strangers
repayryng into this realme might lawfully bring into
the saide realme printed and written bokes to sell at
their libertie and pleasure. By force of which provision
there hath comen into this realme sithen the makynge
of the same, a marvellous number of printed bookes
and dayly doth. And the cause of the making of the
same provision semeth to be, for that there were but
few bookes and fewe printers within this realme at that
time, whiche could well exercise and occupie the said
science and crafte of printynge. Nevertheless, sithen
the making of the saide provision, many of this realme
being the Kinges naturall subjectes, have given them
so diligently to lerne and exercise the saide craft of
printing that at this day there be within this realme
a great number of connyng and experte in the said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
science or crafte of printing, as able to exercise the saide
crafte in all pointes as any stranger in any other realme
or country.”</p>

<p>Though the preamble of this Act speaks only of
printing, it was mainly directed against the foreign
bookbinders and stationers. By it it was forbidden to
import any foreign printed books ready bound, and no
one was to buy from any foreigner residing in England
any books except “by engrosse,” that is, wholesale.
This you will see completely stopped the trade of the
foreign binder in the English market, and absolutely
did away with the foreign stationer in England. One
effect of the Act is apparent in the extraordinary
number of letters of denisation taken out at that date.
In 1582 Christopher Barker wrote: “In the time of
King Henry VIII there were but few printers and those
of good credit and competent wealth, at whiche time
and before there was another sort of men, that were
writers, lymners of bookes and dyverse thinges for the
Churche and other uses called stacioners; which have
and partly to this day do use to buy their bookes in
grosse of the said printers, to bynde them up and sell
them in their shops, whereby they well mayntayned
their families.”</p>

<p>The fifty years then between 1484 and 1534 are the
really interesting years in the history of the English
book trade, when it was free and unprotected, but
though we have a fair amount of information about the
latter half of this time, the earlier half is almost
destitute of any kind of records. The books of the
original company of stationers in London have all
disappeared, and we are dependent mostly on incidental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
references in deeds, in wills, or other legal
documents.</p>

<p>Two years before the Act was passed, namely in
1482, we know of two foreign booksellers who had come
to London, Henry Frankenberg and Bernard van
Stondo, who rented an alley in St Clement’s Lane
called St Mark’s Alley. From their names they would
appear to have come from the Low Countries, but we
know nothing about them or their business beyond
the fact that Frankenberg commissioned his fellow-countryman,
William de Machlinia, who was printing
in London, to print for him an edition of the <i>Speculum
Christiani</i>, about which I spoke in my last lecture.
Their names in the deed and Frankenberg’s name in a
colophon are the only clues we have to the existence of
two probably important booksellers. So also in the
very year of the Act we find foreign dealers in books
trading in Oxford with the resident university stationer.
In 1485 Peter Actors, a native of Savoy trading in
London, was appointed by Henry VII, Stationer to the
King.</p>

<p>About 1486 at Louvain, Egidius vander Heerstraten
printed an edition of the <i>Regulae Grammaticales</i>
of Nicolas Perott, which contains a great number of
passages in English. These are very curious, and seem
to have been translated by one not very conversant
with the language. Here is a passage which refers to
the fifteenth century substitute for compulsory football:
“who someuer of my discipulis goyeth awey fyrst from
the gammyng wt owt my licence i shal smyte his hande
wyt a rode. And yf he do the samyn thyng twyss i
shall also beet hym wyt a leyshe.” In another place,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
having translated the Latin phrase, “Quintilianus est
eloquens sed nihil ad Ciceronem,” “Quintilian is a wel
spoken man but nothyng to Tully,” he adds another
and more personal example: “Helia Perott is fayr but
nothing to Penelope.”</p>

<p>I am not sure whether we ought to consider this book
as one printed for the purpose of exportation to England,
or whether it was not rather intended for the use of
English students at the foreign universities. This is
made more probable from the fact that in a few cases
we have words translated into Dutch prefaced by “as
we say.” I have seen it stated that a similar edition
was printed by the same printer with explanations in
French, but I have not been able to verify the existence
of any copy.</p>

<p>About 1486, too, was issued the first edition of the
Sarum <i>Missal</i>, printed, it is supposed, at Basle by
Wenssler, though some doubts have been raised as to
whether it was really printed at Basle on account of the
appearance of the music type. It is a very handsome
folio volume of 278 leaves, printed in a large Gothic
type in red and black. The printer has not attempted
to print the English portions of the wedding service,
but has left blank spaces where they occur, so that they
might be written in by hand. The first few editions of
the Sarum <i>Missal</i> are all similar in this respect, but it
is curious that Caxton, who had an edition specially
printed for him, should not have supplied the printer
with correct copies for these small portions of the service.</p>

<p>In the next few years a few grammatical books
were issued, printed as a rule in the Low Countries.
In 1486 Gerard Leeu printed the <i>Vulgaria Terentii</i>, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
series of Latin sentences with translations into English,
an edition reprinted from the Oxford one of a year or
two earlier. This book is sometimes found printed as a
supplement to the <i>Grammar</i> by John Anwykyll, and of
this <i>Grammar</i> there are two foreign editions, one
printed by Paffroed at Deventer in 1489, and another
rather later by Henry Quentell at Cologne. The
<i>Grammar</i> does not contain an author’s name, but in
the prefatory verses written by Petrus Carmelianus he
is referred to as Joannes. There are also verses written
to William Waynflete, Bishop of Winchester, and
founder of Magdalen College, Oxford, congratulating
him on having persuaded this Joannes to edit the
<i>Grammar</i>. The book is supposed to have been
intended for the use of the Magdalen College School, in
which the two grammarians John Anwykyll and John
Stanbridge were masters, and is supposed to have been
the work of Anwykyll. The two earliest editions were
printed at Oxford, but by 1486 the Oxford Press had
stopped work and the two succeeding editions were
printed abroad.</p>

<p>The <i>Liber Equivocorum</i> and <i>Liber Synonymorum</i>,
the former wrongly attributed to Joannes de Garlandia
were also printed in the Low Countries, the first at
Deventer by Paffroed, the second at Antwerp by
Thierry Martens in 1493. The <i>Liber Synonymorum</i>
has the commentary of Galfridus Anglicus. A copy of
this book sold in the Ratcliffe sale in the last century
was described as having been printed at Antwerp in
1492, but this must have been, I suppose, a misprint
for 1493.</p>

<p>Three more books printed in the Low Countries I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
ought to mention before turning to France. One is an
edition of Clement Maydeston’s <i>Directorium Sacerdotum</i>,
printed by Gerard Leeu in 1488, of which there is a
copy in the Cambridge University Library.</p>

<p>Another is an edition of the Sarum <i>Horae</i>, also
printed by Leeu, which I am afraid has to be spoken of
at present as a lost book. The only fragment known,
an unused half sheet containing eight leaves, had been
used to line the binding of a copy of the <i>Scriptores rei
rusticae</i> printed at Reggio in 1496, in Brasenose College
library; Bradshaw saw the fragment and took down a
description of it, but on its return to Oxford it was
mislaid and is not to be found.</p>

<p>The third book is another edition of the Sarum
<i>Breviary</i>, printed at Louvain in 1499 by Thierry
Martens. The only copy known is in the Musée Plantin
at Antwerp. Leaving the Low Countries for a time we
will turn to France.</p>

<p>The <i>Missal</i> printed for Caxton in 1487 I have
already described in an earlier lecture, so I can pass on
to the edition which succeeded it, that printed by
Martin Morin, the celebrated printer of Rouen in 1492.
This Morin was by far the most important of the
Norman stationers and printers, and he appears to have
excelled in the printing of service books, for he was
employed by printers and publishers from all parts to
print the service books for the special uses of the towns
where they resided.</p>

<p>For England he printed altogether six service books
in the fifteenth century. Three <i>Missals</i>, two <i>Breviaries</i>,
and a <i>Liber Festivalis</i>, and of these the <i>Missal</i> of 1492
is the earliest. The two copies known of this book,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
both slightly imperfect, are in the British Museum and
the Bodleian. It contains, like the earlier edition
printed for Caxton, two full-page engravings before the
Canon of the Mass, not one only, as is more generally
the case.</p>

<p>The two later <i>Missals</i> which he issued, one without
date but about 1495 and another dated 1497, appear to
have been mixed up by all writers. The undated
edition appears the rarest, for the only copy which I
have noted is in the British Museum. Of the dated
edition I have notes of five; one at Windsor in the
Royal library, one in St Catharine’s College, one at
Chatsworth, one in the Aberdeen University Library,
and the fifth at Kinnaird Castle. I owe my knowledge
of the existence of this last copy to almost the last book
in which one would seek for bibliographical information,
that handy work of reference <i>Who’s Who</i>. Both
editions are very handsome books, remarkable for their
fine titles and initial letters.</p>

<p>Of the two <i>Breviaries</i> which Morin printed the
earliest is dated 1496, and the only copy known is in
the University Library at Edinburgh, to which it was
bequeathed in 1577 by Clement Litill, who left a number
of valuable books to that library, of which he was practically
the founder. It is a magnificent folio volume
of 437 leaves, and contains a fairly full imprint, which
after a deal of very grandiloquent language tells us
that the book was printed at the cost of Jean Richard,
“by the industry of that man skilled in printing,
Mr Martin Morin, a not unworthy citizen of that great
city Rouen.” Morin’s colophons I may note rarely err
on the side of modesty. The Jean Richard mentioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
was a stationer of Rouen, and one who appears to have
had considerable dealings with England. I do not
think he was a printer, as is often stated, and he
describes himself as a dealer in books, not a printer,
using sometimes the word merchant of books and
sometimes the word stationer.</p>

<p>It was for him that Morin printed in 1499 an edition
of Mirk’s <i>Liber Festivalis</i> and <i>Quattuor Sermones</i>, a
copy of which is in the Sandars collection in the
University Library. For him also, in 1500, a Sarum
<i>Manual</i> was printed by Petrus Olivier and Joannes de
Lorraine, of which there is a copy in the Bodleian, and
during the early years of the sixteenth century a
considerable number of service books for the English
market were printed at his expense.</p>

<p>The names of a number of early stationers who
probably traded between Rouen and England are to be
found in the imprints of the early Sarum <i>Missals</i>, for
as the printing of them entailed a good deal of expense
a number of booksellers would combine to pay for the
edition. Rouen seems to have been, amongst all the
towns of France, the most connected with England as
regards the book trade. It was there many of our
printers, as well as the first Scottish printers, learned
their art or obtained their materials, while stationers
from that town crossed over and sold their books in
this country.</p>

<p>We know that Ingelbert Haghe, the publisher of
the Hereford <i>Breviary</i> of 1505, came over himself and
sold books at Hereford and in the country round. On
the fly-leaf of a Bible formerly in the library of
Gloucester Cathedral is a Latin inscription which runs:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
“I gave to the Hereford bookseller called Ingelbert for
this and the six other volumes of the Bible 43 shillings
and fourpence, which I bought at Ludlow the year of
our Lord’s incarnation 1510, about the day of the
Lichfield fair.” Whether the Bible is still in the
Gloucester Cathedral library I do not know, but the
fly-leaves which once belonged to it are in a bundle of
scraps in the Bodleian.</p>

<p>Another Rouen printer issued in 1495 an edition of
the <i>Liber Festivalis</i>. His name was James Ravynell,
and this is the only book that he is known to have
printed. It is an exact copy of the edition printed by
W. de Worde in 1493 and ’94, and the type used in it
has a very clean and new appearance. At the end is a
device with the initials P. R., which looks as though it
might have been made for another member of the
family, though we know of no other printer of the
name. The fact that he uses the English form of the
Christian name in the imprint, “By me, James
Ravynell,” looks as if he was an Englishman who had
migrated to Rouen.</p>

<p>The device consists of the initials P. R. on a shield
suspended by a belt from a tree and supported by two
muzzled bears. Below the shield two birds hold up a
wreath. Round the whole runs the text: “Junior fui
etenim senui et non vidi justum derelictum nec semen
ejus querens panem.” The name Ravynell is a curious
one, and may be a corrupted spelling of a commoner
name, though it is still borne by some families of
Huguenot descent.</p>

<p>Another mysterious book, which from its type may
very well have been printed at Rouen, is an edition of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
the little grammar called <i>Parvula</i>. It consists only of
four leaves, and the only copy known is at Manchester.
The book ends: “Here endeth a treatise called parvula,
for the instruction of children. Emprentyd by me
Nicole Marcant.” In the exasperating way common to
some printers both the date and place of printing are
omitted. As to the date I am inclined to put it before
1500, but the place is more difficult to settle. Nicole
Marcant is an unknown printer, but may very well be a
member of one of the numerous families of Marchand
or Mercator, for there were several printers of that
name, though none so far as I know named Nicholas.</p>

<p>If we except the <i>Missal</i> printed for Caxton in 1487
it was not until 1494 that the Paris printers began to
work for the English market, and the books they
produced were almost all liturgical. The only exceptions
are three editions of grammatical works, two of the
<i>Liber Equivocorum</i> wrongly ascribed to Joannes de
Garlandia, and one of the <i>Liber Synonymorum</i>, the first
two printed by Baligault and the last by Hopyl.</p>

<p>The first liturgical book was an edition of the Sarum
<i>Breviary</i>, printed in 1494 by Pierre Levet. For a long
time only one copy was known, that in the library at
Trinity College, Dublin, but not long ago the University
Library was fortunate enough to secure a second
example, a very beautiful copy in its old binding.</p>

<p>In one thing the Paris printers excelled all others,
and that was in the production of books of Hours. These
were turned out in the last few years of the century
by hundreds of thousands, and though they are now of
very common occurrence and very often of little interest,
they are still much sought after by certain classes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
collectors, especially those who like what they call
pretty books. Of course, when these books were
printed for the use of out of the way places they have
often great liturgical interest, and being printed no
doubt in small quantities are very rare. The English
service books having been relentlessly destroyed at the
Reformation are very rare indeed. Altogether in the
fifteenth century twenty-seven editions of the Sarum
<i>Horae</i> were printed, fifteen in England, one at Antwerp,
one at Venice, and ten in Paris. Nine English editions
were printed before one was issued at Paris, but these
latter when once they got a footing in England easily
defied competition. The changes in the text of these
books during the last ten years of the century are very
curious and interesting. The <i>Horae</i> was not a service
book proper, but a manual of private devotion, and so
long as it contained certain fixed and definite parts
additional prayers could be added at will. Consequently
the editions vary greatly, and each publisher seems to
have aimed at inserting new and popular prayers, and
by 1500 the book had increased to almost double the
bulk of its forerunner of ten years earlier.</p>

<p>In speaking of these books there is one point on
which a word of warning may be said. And that is
about dating editions which have no date in the
imprint. All such are usually put down to 1488, which
is the first date printed in the calendar of moveable
feasts. As this calendar was made out for a nineteen
year cycle running on to 1508 it was naturally
not reprinted for many years, and therefore is no
test for dating the printing of the book. The ten
editions printed at Paris are the work of about five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
printers, of whom the most important was Felix
Baligault.</p>

<p>The study of these French books of Hours is not
an easy one, as there is so much confusion between
printers and publishers. In some cases I am afraid the
publishers used the words “printed by” in a quite
unwarrantable manner, and claimed to have produced
books which they had done nothing more than pay for.
Then again quite half the editions produced for sale in
England are without any imprint, so that we are left to
conjecture who was the printer from the type or cuts
used in the books. To further bewilder us, sets of cuts
passed from printer to printer, and are very untrustworthy
guides in assigning books. If one printer issued
a <i>Horae</i> with a fine set of cuts they were promptly
copied by his rivals, who in their turn sold their old
sets to less wealthy printers, in fact some sets of cuts
change hands almost every year.</p>

<p>These books are all got up in the same style, the
text surrounded on every page by deep borders containing
figures of saints and martyrs or pictures from
the Dance of Death.</p>

<p>One unique edition, printed by Jean Poitevin about
1498, was picked up lately in Ireland and bought by
the librarian of Trinity College, Dublin, for a small sum.</p>

<p>A service book of great interest is the first edition
of the Sarum <i>Manual</i>, of which the only known copy
is in the library at Caius College. It bears on its first
leaf a Latin inscription stating that it was given to the
College of the Annunciation of the Blessed Mary at
Cambridge by Humphrey de la Poole, son of the Duke
of Suffolk, for the use of the college, in September,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
1498. The book is a folio of 164 leaves, beautifully
printed in red and black by Berthold Rembolt of Paris.
It has no date, but the Greek in the printer’s device
reads ΧΕΡΕΘΗΚΙ, and must therefore be after 1496,
when it read ΧΕΡΕΘΙΚΗ, and as the book was
presented in 1498 we may fairly safely fix the date of
printing about the beginning of 1498. Unfortunately
the last leaf is missing, which may have contained an
imprint giving the exact date and stating for whom the
book was printed.</p>

<p>The last service book to be noticed is a Sarum
<i>Missal</i> printed by Jean du Pré at Paris in 1500. Unfortunately
all the copies of this book are imperfect,
though from the three copies known an exact collation
can be made. Another <i>Missal</i> was printed at Paris in
the same year by Higman and Hopyl for two unknown
persons, I.B. and G.H.</p>

<p>All these service books though most interesting
liturgically are almost the most uninteresting class of
book to the bibliographer. They were issued by well-known
printers, and are hardly different from the great
mass of foreign service books. From them early in the
sixteenth century, however, we derive a good deal of
information about the stationers, especially as regards
the provincial presses; for in the case of a town like
York hardly anything seems to have been printed
beyond liturgical books.</p>

<p>So far the books we have been speaking of have been
for the most part in Latin, with some sentences here
and there in English, printed, of course, for the English
market, but not of much interest from the point of
view of literature. But we now come to another small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
group of English books, printed entirely in English, of
very much greater interest.</p>

<p>In 1492 and 1493, when, just after the death of
Caxton, the English press was almost at a standstill,
Gerard Leeu of Antwerp printed four English books of
considerable interest. Three of them were reprints of
books already printed by Caxton, Lefevre’s <i>History
of Jason</i>, the <i>History of Paris and Vienne</i>, and the
<i>Chronicles of England</i>. The fourth book was <i>The
Dialogue or Communyng between the Wise King Solomon
and Marcolphus</i>. Of this there does not seem to have
been any other English edition, though many Latin
ones were printed in the fifteenth century, and it is
possible, though hardly probable, that Caxton might
have printed an edition which has entirely disappeared.</p>

<p>Lefevre’s <i>History of Jason</i> is a small folio of ninety-eight
leaves, illustrated with a number of half-page
cuts clearly made to illustrate the book in which they
first appear. They were used in several editions of the
<i>Jason</i> in different languages, the earliest in Dutch
having been printed by Bellaert at Haarlem about
1485. There are copies of the English edition at
Trinity College, Dublin, and in the library at Chatsworth,
and a third copy, slightly imperfect, is in the
University Library.</p>

<p>The <i>History of Paris and Vienne</i>, which was
printed exactly three weeks after the <i>History of Jason</i>,
is a still rarer book, only one copy being known, which
is in the library at Trinity College, Dublin. It, like
the <i>Jason</i>, is illustrated with a series of half-page wood
engravings, which Mr Conway, in his <i>History of the
Woodcutters of the Netherlands</i>, conjectures to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
been originally used in an edition printed by Bellaert
at Haarlem, which has now entirely disappeared, and
then to have passed from his possession into the hands
of Gerard Leeu. It is a small folio of forty leaves, and
the copy at Dublin is bound up with the <i>Jason</i> and the
<i>Chronicles</i>.</p>

<p>The next book to be noticed, the <i>Dialogue or
Communyng between the Wise King Solomon and
Marcolphus</i>, is very interesting, being the only English
edition of this version of a widespread and popular
story. It tells how Solomon, seated on his throne, is
confronted by Marcolphus, a misshapen rustic who
answers with a certain coarse wit the questions put to
him by the king. Later on the king visits Marcolphus,
who in his turn comes to reside at court, but his
behaviour there is so insolent that the king can hardly
put up with it. After a series of escapades Marcolphus
is banished from the court, and finally sentenced to be
hanged. He is allowed as a favour to choose his own
tree, and consequently he wanders with his guards
through the Vale of Josaphath to Jericho, over Jordan,
through Arabia and the wilderness to the Red Sea, but
“never more could Marcolf find a tree that he wold
choose to hang on.” The curious result of this is that
he went home and lived happily ever afterwards.</p>

<p>The book itself has only one illustration, which is
used twice, on the recto and verso of the title-page,
representing Marcolphus and his wife Polycana standing
before Solomon, who is seated upon his throne. This
cut found its way over to England, and was used by
several successive printers for editions of <i>Howleglas</i>.</p>

<p>The only copy known of <i>Solomon and Marcolphus</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
is in the Bodleian, and was in a volume of tracts
bequeathed with his library by Thomas Tanner, Bishop
of St Asaph. The volume contained originally five
separate pieces. Two by Wynkyn de Worde, the <i>Three
Kings of Coleyne</i> and the <i>Meditations of St Bernard</i>,
two by Caxton, the <i>Governayle of Health</i> and the <i>Ars
moriendi</i>, and the <i>Solomon and Marcolphus</i>. I am sorry
to say that the two Caxtons have been cut out of the
volume and bound separately.</p>

<p>The last of the four books to be noticed is the
edition of the <i>Chronicles of England</i>. While the
<i>Chronicles</i> were being printed Gerard Leeu died, or
perhaps it would be more correct to say was murdered.
One of his workmen named Henric van Symmen, who
was also a type engraver, struck work and determined
to set up in business on his own account. This led to
a quarrel, and blows succeeded words. The workman,
it appears, in the course of the quarrel struck Leeu a
blow on the head, and this proved so serious that he lay
very ill for three days and then died. The workman
was promptly secured and brought up for trial for the
killing of his master, but it was probably considered
that he had received a certain amount of provocation,
and his punishment took the form of a fine. He was
sentenced to pay into the Duke of Burgundy’s exchequer
the sum of forty guelden. Gerard Leeu seems to have
been a good master and a kindly man if we may judge
from the colophon put to the <i>Chronicles</i>: “Enprentyd
In the Duchye of Braband in the towne of Andewarpe
In the yere of our lord M.cccc.xciii. By maister Gerard
de Leew a man of grete wysedom in all maner of
kunnyng: whych nowe is come from lyfe unto the deth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
which is grete harme for many a poure man. On whos
sowle god almyghty for hys hygh grace haue mercy.
Amen.”</p>

<p>The book contains no illustrations beyond a woodcut
of the arms of England on the title-page.</p>

<p>Leeu seems to have intended to print more English
books, for the type in which all but the <i>Chronicles</i> are
printed was a special fount cut in imitation of English
type, with a curious lower-case d for use when that
letter occurred at the end of a word. His death, so
soon after the cutting of the type, put an end to all
such plans. The custom, however, of printing English
books at Antwerp revived at the very beginning of the
sixteenth century, for Adrian van Berghen printed an
edition of Holt’s <i>Lac Puerorum</i>, and John of Doesborch
issued a whole series of English popular books, some of
them remarkably curious.</p>

<p>Among the stationers who came to England from
abroad the most important was certainly Frederick
Egmont. He was probably a Frenchman, but his
printing was mainly done in Venice, and he seems to
have been the agent of the Venetian printer Johannes
Hertzog de Landoia. From this Venetian press came a
large number of service books for English use, editions
of the <i>Breviary</i> and <i>Missal</i>. The Sarum <i>Horae</i> on the
other hand is only represented by one edition, issued
about 1494, of which only a few leaves are known.</p>

<p>Egmont during his earliest years as a stationer was
connected with no press except that of Hertzog, and we
do not know of any books by this printer produced for
any other English stationer, so that as regards liturgical
books for English use known to us only from fragments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
we are justified, I think, in attributing to Egmont as
stationer such as we can determine from their type to
have been printed by Hertzog.</p>

<p>The first book in which his name occurs is an
edition of the <i>Breviary</i> according to the use of York,
of which the only known copy is in the Bodleian,
having been originally in the great liturgical collection
of Richard Gough. It is a small thick octavo of 462
leaves, and was issued in May, 1493. Two if not three
editions of the Sarum <i>Breviary</i> in octavo were printed
about this same time, but we know of their existence
only from fragments discovered in bindings. Fragments
of one edition are in a binding in the library of St
John’s College, Cambridge, of another in a binding at
Lambeth, while some leaves of probably a third edition
are in the library of Corpus Christi College, Oxford.</p>

<p>In 1494 Egmont had commissioned Hertzog to print
for him two editions of the Sarum <i>Missal</i>, one in folio,
the other in octavo. The folio edition is of great rarity,
but there is a beautiful though slightly imperfect copy
in the Sandars collection in the University Library.
The title-page is wanting and also the leaf containing
the engraving of the Crucifixion which should precede
the Canon of the Mass. In the imprint we are told
that the book was finished on the 1st of September,
1494, by John Hertzog de Landoia for Fredericus de
Egmont and Gerardus Barrevelt. This Gerardus Barrevelt
was clearly a partner of Egmont’s as their initials
occur together in the device on the title-page. This
device is remarkable for the delicacy of its execution.
It consists of a circle divided by a perpendicular line
produced beyond the top of the circle, the projection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
being crossed by two bars. In the left-hand half of the
circle are the initials and mark of Egmont, in the right
those of Barrevelt. The whole is enclosed in a square
frame, and the background contains sprays of leaves.
It so resembles in style and appearance the mark used
by the printer John Hertzog that we may be pretty
certain it was cut under his supervision at Venice.</p>

<p>The octavo <i>Missal</i> of 1494, a much commoner book
than the last, was issued in December. On the last
leaf is Hertzog’s mark and the words, “Fredericus
egmont me fieri fecit.” There is no mention of Barrevelt,
and the double device does not occur in the book,
which makes it appear as though this edition was
printed for Egmont alone. Both these editions of the
<i>Missal</i> contain exquisitely designed woodcut initials, the
most graceful to be found in any early book.</p>

<p>In the Bodleian there is a copy of the “Pars estivalis”
of the Sarum <i>Breviary</i> printed at Venice in 1495,
which contains again the device of Egmont and Barrevelt,
though the imprint mentions Egmont’s name only.
After 1495 we hear nothing more of Egmont until 1499,
when he seems to have got rid of his former partner
Barrevelt and joined with a man named Peter post
pascha, and these two commissioned Pynson to print
them an edition of the <i>Promptorium Puerorum</i>. After
1499 Egmont disappeared for a long time; we know of
him working as a bookbinder, and it is probable that
he stayed on for some time in England, for he is mentioned
as a witness in a law-suit in London in 1502.
When he does reappear it is in Paris, where he had
some books printed for him about 1517-1520.</p>

<p>It is very disappointing that we have practically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
no information about Frederick Egmont, for it is clear
from the number of books that he had printed for him
in Venice that he must have been a stationer of very
considerable importance. The colophons of his books
give, beyond his mere name, no information whatever
about him: we do not even know in what part of
London or under what sign he lived. The stationers
seem always to have settled in St Paul’s Churchyard,
and I cannot help thinking that part of that district
may have been “in the liberties,” as it was called, of
some church. Though the Act of Richard allowed
foreigners to come over and trade, yet I do not suppose
his Act could override the rights of the trade guilds.
It certainly did not in York, for there a stationer must
be a freeman by right or by purchase before he could
carry on certain businesses, that of a stationer amongst
the number, within the city. There were, however,
certain liberties where an alien could live and trade;
and we find at York that their earliest stationer, Gerard
Wanseford, does not appear in the city register. Having
taken up his abode within the liberty of St Peter, he
was privileged to carry on business there without being
a freeman of the city.</p>

<p>In the same way in London, I suppose, the various
trades had their rights and could prevent foreigners
from competing, except they resided within the liberties.
Of course there was a Stationers’ Company in London
in the fifteenth century, though unfortunately most of
the records relating to it have disappeared, and it would
protect its own members. We see in the early bindings
how ostentatiously the binders who were freemen decorated
their bindings with the arms of London, and there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
is no doubt that as far as trading in the City was concerned
the foreigner was considerably handicapped in
comparison with the freeman.</p>

<p>We know from the few early documents remaining
that the London Company of Stationers was a powerful
and important body, and the members of it must certainly
have enjoyed certain privileges.</p>

<p>Nicholas Lecomte was another stationer who appears
to have been settled in England by 1494, in which
year, so far as I know, his first dated book appears.
M. Madden, a French writer on early printing, in the
fifth volume of his <i>Lettres d’une Bibliographe</i>, speaks
of Hopyl having printed a book for Lecomte in 1493.
Several times in writing to him I asked for some information
about this book, its whereabouts or its name
even, but though he sent always voluminous replies
to my letters, he never would touch on this particular
point. I think, therefore, we may consider that this
1493 book never existed, and take the 1494 book as
the first. This was an edition of the <i>Liber Synonymorum</i>,
printed by Hopyl, of which there are copies in
the University Library, the British Museum, and the
Bodleian.</p>

<p>In the imprint Lecomte is described as living in
London by St Paul’s Churchyard at the sign of St
Nicholas. His device depicts St Nicholas restoring
to life the three children who had been killed and
pickled, a favourite subject of the early bookbinders.</p>

<p>I think it is worth noting here, that so far as I can
discover the sign of a house was not in any way
permanent, but could apparently be changed at will.
I noticed this in reading through a catalogue or <i>précis</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
of some thousands of deeds relating to property in
London at this time and a little earlier. We find endless
notices of houses with changed signs, “the tenement
now called the Rose, formerly the Lion,” the “house
called the Bull, formerly called the Rose,” and so on.
Naturally if a house got celebrated for any reason it
would be politic to keep the sign, but there seems to
have been no compulsion to do so.</p>

<p>In 1495 an edition of Mirk’s <i>Liber Festivalis</i> and
<i>Quattuor Sermones</i> was printed by Hopyl for Lecomte.
This contains Lecomte’s device at the end of the <i>Liber
Festivalis</i> and a curious device at the end of the <i>Quattuor
Sermones</i>, used sometimes by Hopyl, but which does
not bear on its face any appearance of having been made
for him.</p>

<p>At the time when this book was printed Hopyl had
in his office as press corrector an Edinburgh man called
David Lauxius, the earliest Scotchman we know of
employed in a printing-office. He afterwards became
a schoolmaster at Arras, and appears to have been a man
of considerable ability, and a friend of the celebrated
Parisian printer and editor, Badius Ascensius, who addresses
to him some of the prefatory letters in his
grammars. What Scotch name is represented by the
Latin Lauxius no one has yet been able to determine.</p>

<p>The last book printed for Lecomte was printed at
Paris by Jean Jehannot, and is an edition of the Sarum
<i>Horae</i>. It is a book of very great rarity, but there are
two copies in Cambridge, one in Trinity College, and
the other in the Sandars collection in the University
Library, the latter containing a small supplement not
found in the other copies, and which was not originally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
intended to form part of the book, since the prayers in
it are not referred to in the list of contents. The imprint
is curious; it states that the edition has been revised
and corrected in the celebrated University of Paris,
and printed for Nicolas Lecomte of that University,
settled for the time being in England as a merchant of
books. I do not know whether this means merely that
he was educated at the University or whether he was
one of the privileged stationers attached to it, though
in the latter case he would hardly have come to settle
in England. Like Frederick Egmont, Lecomte was also
a bookbinder.</p>

<p>Before the end of the century another stationer was
settled in England whose name we know, John Boudins.
We know of only one book printed for him, an edition
of the <i>Expositio Hymnorum et Sequentiarum</i> of Salisbury
use, which was printed at the beginning of 1502 by
Bocard of Paris. Boudins was probably then an old
man, for his will is dated the 11th of October, 1501,
and it was proved on the 30th of March, 1503. He
lived in the parish of St Clement’s, Eastcheap, and was
apparently a naturalised Fleming, and an immigrant
from Antwerp.</p>

<p>A great difficulty in the way of tracing these stationers,
especially those from the Low Countries, is the
very sparing use they made of their proper surnames.
In legal documents such as wills or letters of denization
the formal name would be given, whereas in ordinary
parlance and in the imprints of books they would be
spoken of by a kind of nickname taken from the town
from which they came, like William de Machlinia,
Wynkyn de Worde, and so on. So that we should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
probably find, if we had more information on the
subject, that in many cases two men who are treated
as different may turn out to be only one man under
two names. The number of stationers that existed at
this time in England was probably very large, and
it is sad to think that our information on the subject is
so meagre. Of course unless the stationer was wealthy
enough or in a good way of business he would not be
able to commission whole editions of books from a foreign
printer, and therefore he would not have his name in
the imprint. Then again the greater part of a stationer’s
stock would consist of foreign books which were not
necessarily printed for England. For information of this
class we can only look to manuscript sources, accounts
kept by the bookseller, lists of imported books, and so on.</p>

<p>There exists, for instance, a list of books for sale at
Oxford in 1483 by Thomas Hunte, which has been
edited by Mr Madan for the Oxford Historical Society.
At the head of the list is the following sentence
in Latin: “Here follows the inventory of the
books which I, Thomas Hunte, stationer of the University
of Oxford, have received from Master Peter
Actors and John of Aix-la-Chapelle to sell, with the
price of each book, and I promise faithfully to return
the books or the money according to the price written
below as it appears in the following list.” The two
men mentioned were travelling stationers from London,
supplying so much stock to the bookseller on a system
of sale or return.</p>

<p>A document such as the <i>Day-book of John Dorne</i>,
the journal or account-book of an Oxford bookseller in
1520, which was edited by Mr Madan for the Oxford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
Historical Society, and about which Henry Bradshaw
wrote his <i>Half-century of Notes</i>, the last piece of work
which he finished, is a find of the utmost importance in
our subject, and it is perhaps not too much to expect
that more documents of this kind may be forthcoming.
In the account-book we notice that after the 21st of
May up to the 3rd of August there is an entire blank,
and Dorne begins his account-book again “post recessum
meum de ultra mare.” I think we should be safe in
concluding that these months were spent abroad on
business and in the purchase of books.</p>

<p>Sometimes such information is found amongst the
waste leaves used to make boards for bindings. The
University Librarian read a note before the Antiquarian
Society here giving an account of a letter on business
matters written from a foreign printer to John Siberch,
the first printer in Cambridge, which was found among
other waste matter used to make the boards of a
binding now in Westminster Abbey Library, and letters
of bookbinders have been found in the same way.</p>

<p>We have not, unfortunately, any book however
meagre on this subject which might serve as a basis
on which to build up information. Isolated facts turn
up occasionally here or there, but there being no
regular place for us to put them they drop out of sight
again. And it is only when we have collected a number
of these facts and begin to find the links that piece
them together that we can arrive at any definite
knowledge of the subject.</p>

<p>I do not suppose we may expect to find much new information
from books themselves, but from manuscript
sources a good deal may yet be discovered. Within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
the last year or two many documents relating to
stationers and printers of the early sixteenth century
have been found at the Record Office, and there must
be many more still to be found there; besides, the
documents in the Record Office are only a part of our
great collections.</p>

<p>However, as I said before, what we most want is an
account as full as possible of the booksellers and
stationers up to 1535, giving us all the information
that has yet been discovered, to serve as a groundwork
for what may be found in the future.</p>

</div>

<p class="c">THE BOOKBINDERS.</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">From</span> the very earliest times the bookbindings produced
in England were remarkable for their beauty and
richness. The finest were of gold, ornamented with
gems, but their value has led to their destruction, and
I do not think that there is any early binding of this
class now in existence. Leather was very soon recognised
as a suitable material for book-covers, being easily
worked and capable of receiving a considerable amount
of ornament. The earliest leather binding known is on
a beautiful little manuscript of St John’s Gospel, taken
from the tomb of St Cuthbert, and now preserved in
the library of Stonyhurst College. It is of red leather,
and the centre of the side is ornamented with a raised
ornament of Celtic design, while above and below are
small panels filled with interlaced lines, executed
apparently with a pointed tool and coloured yellow.
This binding is generally considered to be of the tenth
century, though there are some reasons for thinking
that it may have been executed later, but if this is so
the present binding must have been copied from an
earlier one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>Excellent as the early work had been, that of the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries is unsurpassed. The
leather bindings executed at Durham for Bishop Pudsey
between 1153 and 1195 are marvellous both for their
detail and for their general effect. It was the custom
of binders of this period to build up a bold and effective
pattern covering the whole side of the book by means
of a large number of dies, beautifully engraved with
different designs. On the four volumes of Bishop
Pudsey’s Bible, now in the Cathedral library at
Durham, no less than fifty-one different dies are used,
and when we remember that Bishop Pudsey was one of
the great builders of the cathedral, it is not surprising
that the ornamentation on the dies used in these bindings
should resemble the carved work in the cathedral.
There are in the Cathedral library seven of these early
bindings, and, unfortunately, they have suffered a considerable
amount of mutilation at a not very remote
date, for visitors on payment of a small gratuity to the
person who looked after the library were allowed to cut
out with a penknife one of the stamps to keep as a
curiosity. A few more Durham bindings, easily recognised
by the dies, are scattered in different libraries in
London and in France.</p>

<p>At Winchester, also, and London very beautiful
work of the same class was produced, the circular form
of decoration being very much made use of. Perhaps
the finest piece of Winchester work now in existence is
the binding of the <i>Winchester Domesday Book</i> in the
library of the Society of Antiquaries, of which a
facsimile was published in the illustrated catalogue of
the exhibition of bookbindings at the Burlington Fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
Arts Club. Some very fine work, too, probably executed
at Winchester, is to be found on some manuscripts in
the library of the Faculty of Medicine at Montpellier
executed before 1146 for Henry, son of Louis VII of
France.</p>

<p>The metal dies with which these bindings were
stamped were practically indestructible, but it is curious
to notice that they hardly ever appear to have been
used after the twelfth and early thirteenth centuries.
In Westminster Abbey library is a copy of the
<i>Epistolae</i> of Ficinus, printed in 1495, which has its
covers ornamented with early Winchester stamps, and
another binding worked with twelfth century dies is on
a fifteenth century printed book in the library of Corpus
Christi College, Cambridge.</p>

<p>In all these early bindings one is especially struck
with the extraordinary taste and balance in the decoration.
The dies themselves are beautiful, and the
pattern in which they are built up is also beautiful,
and yet neither are unduly emphasised. In later
bindings the die became smaller and less finely cut.
It was not intended to be decorative in itself, but only
to help to build up patterns, and the bindings in
consequence lose much of their interest.</p>

<p>Oxford, I believe, is generally credited with clinging
somewhat strongly to old traditions, and certainly its
bookbinders did so in the fifteenth century. From the
earliest times bookbinding had been considerably
practised there and continued without a break, and no
doubt that is why the old styles lingered for so long.
The bindings produced there towards the end of the
century form the connecting link between the old styles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
and the new. They represent the last survival of the
early English school of work, that very distinctive
English style which depended so much on the disposal
of dies into large circles, or parallelograms one inside
the other, such as we find in the Winchester and
Durham bindings of the twelfth or thirteenth centuries.
That this circular work was not the haphazard freak of
a single binder we can see from the fact that several
of the dies are wider at the top than at the bottom, so
that when placed together side by side they would
naturally work round to a circular form, like the stones
forming the arch of a bridge. These dies are in many
cases foreign in design and may have been introduced
by Rood, the first printer, but the style of binding is
essentially English. Some bindings of a rather similar
appearance, though never with any circular ornament,
were produced in the Low Countries. On nearly all
Oxford bindings will be found little groups of three
small circles, so small that they might have been done
with the end of a watch-key, and arranged in a triangle.
This ornament I have never seen on any but Oxford
work. One habit connects the Oxford binders with
those of the Low Countries, and that is their habit of
always, when possible, lining the boards of the binding
with leaves of vellum rather than paper. All the other
English binders used paper generally for this purpose.
It is owing to this custom of using vellum that many
copies of <i>Indulgences</i> issued by the early printers have
been preserved, for, as they were only printed on one
side, the binder could paste them down with the
printed side next the boards and the clean side
outwards. An Oxford binding with an inscription<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
stating that it was bound in “Catte Strete” in 1467
was formerly in the British Museum: the manuscript
which it covered has been rebound and the old binding
has disappeared.</p>

<p>Caxton, as one would naturally expect, followed the
style of binding which he had become used to during
his residence at Bruges, though it is interesting to
notice that one at least of his dies was directly copied
from early London work and applied in the same
manner. His general method of covering the side of
his binding was to make a large centre panel contained
by a framework of dies or lines running about an inch
from the edge of the side and intersecting each other
at the corners as in the frame known as an Oxford
frame. The large panel thus produced on the side was
divided into lozenge-shaped compartments by diagonal
lines running both ways from the frame, and in each of
these compartments a die was stamped. The die most
commonly found on his bindings is a square one with
some fabulous winged monster engraved upon it, and
this very die we find later in the hands of a stationer
in London named Jacobi. The broad frame was often
made up by repetitions of a triangular stamp, pointing
alternately right and left, and containing the figure of
a dragon. This stamp is interesting, not only because
the use of a triangular stamp was very uncommon, but
because it was an exact copy of one used by a London
binder about the end of the twelfth century. Very few
of Caxton’s own books in their original binding have
come down to our time, but there is a copy of the
second edition of the <i>Liber Festivalis</i> in the British
Museum which was clearly bound by him, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
<i>Boethius</i> which was found in the Grammar School at
St Alban’s was also in its original cover. The <i>Royal
Book</i> formerly in the Bedfordshire General Library, and
now in the collection of Mr J. Pierpont Morgan, is in an
absolutely similar binding to the <i>Liber Festivalis</i> in the
British Museum, ornamented with the same die, while
the boards were lined with two waste copies of an
<i>Indulgence</i>. Caxton’s bindings were invariably of
leather; he never used vellum as many writers have
stated. Blades, who was amongst the number, refers to
a vellum-bound Caxton in the Bodleian, and states
that it is the original binding; but had he examined
the book more carefully he would have found that it
was made up from two copies, and that the binding
therefore could not well be original. Indeed the
particular binding was put on in the seventeenth
century while the book belonged to Selden. Selden’s
bindings had good need to be flexible, for one of his
customs did not tend to improve bindings. He used to
buy his spectacles, like the youth in the <i>Vicar of
Wakefield</i>, by the gross, and whenever he stopped reading
a book he put in the pair he happened to be using
to mark the place. It was quite a common thing, soon
after his library came to the Bodleian, for spectacles to
drop out of the books as they were taken incautiously
from the shelves.</p>

<p>Of course the number of bindings which can with
certainty be ascribed to Caxton is necessarily small, we
can in the first place take only those on books printed
by him, and which contain distinct evidence from the
fragments used in the binding that they came from his
workshop. By means of the stamps used on these we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
can identify others which have no other materials for
identification. Caxton used sometimes wooden boards
in his bindings and sometimes waste leaves of printed
matter pasted together. These pads of old printing
frequently yield most valuable prizes. The copy of
Caxton’s <i>Boethius</i>, found by Blades in the library of the
St Alban’s Grammar-school, had its boards made of
printed matter, which, when carefully taken to pieces,
were found to be made of fifty-six half-sheets of paper,
forming portions of thirteen books printed by Caxton,
three of which were quite unknown.</p>

<p>Caxton’s binding stamps passed with his printing
material to his successor, Wynkyn de Worde. I
found in a college library at Oxford a book with these
stamps, evidently bound by De Worde, and the boards
were lined with waste leaves of three books printed by
him, one being unknown, and one by Caxton. De
Worde’s bindings are the least easily identified of any
in the fifteenth century, for beyond these few dies of
Caxton’s there are none that can definitely be ascribed
to him, and even the various bindings that might be
ascribed to him from the fragments found in them
vary so much in style and decoration that it seems
impossible that they could have all come from one shop.
Perhaps he had really no binding establishment of
his own, but got such work as he required done by
others.</p>

<p>Wynkyn de Worde, as we learn from his will,
employed several binders. He left bequests to Alard,
bookbinder, his servant, and to Nowel, the bookbinder
in Shoe Lane. James Gaver, who was one of his
executors, was one of the large family of Gavere,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
binders in the Low Countries, and though, when he
took out letters of denization on his own account in
1535 he is described as a stationer, no doubt he was
also a bookbinder. The square stamp with a dragon,
which had belonged to Caxton and which must have
passed to De Worde, found its way early in the
sixteenth century with other dies of Caxton’s into the
hands of another stationer, Henry Jacobi.</p>

<p>The bindings which were produced by Lettou and
Machlinia, so far as we are able to identify them, are
very plain. The sides are divided by diagonal lines into
diamond-shaped compartments, and in each is stamped
a small and uninteresting die. The Latin Bible in the
library of Jesus College, Cambridge, which has every quire
lined with slips of vellum, portions of two cut-up copies
of Lettou’s <i>Indulgence</i>, and presumably bound by him,
has its binding ornamented with diagonal lines within
a frame formed of square dies containing the figure of
a fabulous animal. In the diamond-shaped compartments
formed by the diagonal lines is a small impressed
cinquefoil. Another Lettou binding, on the copy of the
<i>Wallensis</i> printed by him in 1481 in the Bodleian, is
ornamented simply with diagonal lines, but has no
small stamps.</p>

<p>There is another English binder of this time whose
name we do not know, who produced some very good
work. Bradshaw, I think, considered that he worked
at Norwich. There are a number of his books in
Cambridge libraries, and he used very often a red-coloured
leather, which is common in Cambridge
bindings. His dies are Low Country in type, and very
much resemble those used at Oxford, but his work can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
be recognised by two peculiarities. He always ruled
two perpendicular lines down the backs of his books,
and always ornamented the ends of the bands, the
bands being those ridges on the back where the
leather covers the string or cord on which the quires
are stitched. Where these bands ended on the sides
he printed a kind of ornament of leaves. He also, like
the Oxford binders, almost always lined his boards with
vellum. His dies, about eighteen in number, are well
engraved, one in especial representing two cocks fighting,
being very finely executed.</p>

<p>Pynson’s earliest bindings are as a rule very plain.
Like the other binders of the time he ruled diagonal
lines across the sides of his books, and put a small die
in each division. Sometimes he did not even use a die,
but contented himself with plain lines, as, for instance,
on the copy of his first dated book of 1492 in the
British Museum. His bindings, like Machlinia’s, are
very plain, and the dies used are small and poor.</p>

<p>Another binder, perhaps at St Alban’s, produced
bindings not unlike Pynson’s, but he is identified by a
small circular die which he used, which has on it the
figure of a bird.</p>

<p>Another binder whose initials were W. G., but
whose name we do not know, produced a large number
of bindings in the fifteenth century. It is from his
bindings that all the fragments of Machlinia’s <i>Horae
ad usum Sarum</i> have been recovered, for he seems to
have used up a copy for lining his boards, and luckily
several books bound about that time have been preserved.
Bradshaw found a curious case of the preservation
of two volumes bound in the same workshop about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
the same time. In the library of St John’s College,
Cambridge, is a copy of a book printed at Nuremberg in
1505, which has in its cover some leaves of early Oxford
printing. In the library at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge,
is an exactly similar binding on a book printed at
Lyons in 1511, which also contains some early Oxford
leaves. Now it is clear that the same man must have
bound these books about the same time, because we find
in both, along with the refuse Oxford leaves, some leaves
from one and the same vellum manuscript.</p>

<p>There is one English binder, who worked before the
end of the fifteenth century, who is distinctly worthy of
special mention on account of the striking originality
of his method of decoration and designs. His name,
unfortunately, we do not know, but as one of his most
frequently used dies represents a balance or pair of
scales it has been conjectured that this may be a rebus
on his name, such as many binders used, and that he
was called “Scales.” Two volumes executed by this
binder are known, which were done for a certain William
Langton, and the centre panel is ornamented with a rebus
on the name Langton, the letters Lang over a barrel or
tun, while the rest of the side is filled up with little
stamps. This Langton may perhaps be identified with
the William Langton who was a prebendary of Lincoln
and afterwards of York at the end of the fifteenth
century. Another even more curious binding by this
same man is in the library of Corpus Christi College,
Cambridge. He has disposed his dies so as to form
a large heraldic shield, covering the whole side of a folio
volume, a style of adornment quite unique so far as I
am aware, and as an ornament extremely effective,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
though I am afraid the heraldry is hardly sufficiently
accurate to enable us to determine for whom the volume
was bound.</p>

<p>The bindings that I have spoken of so far were all
produced in a slow and laborious manner, as each die
had to be impressed separately. Towards the end of
the fifteenth century, however, when the printers in
England began to issue books of a small size, a new
system of binding was introduced, by which the labour
of the binder was very considerably lessened, while the
amount of decoration applied was increased.</p>

<p>The invention and use of the panel stamp, that is
of a large stamp which should ornament the side of the
book with one picture, was a great step forward. It
was a great advantage commercially as it saved much
time, and in some ways it was an advance artistically.
By its means the whole side of the book was ornamented
at once, instead of by a series of dies impressed one
after the other. And as the working out of a binding
had ceased to be its main point and the beauty of the
die itself was more emphasised, this invention did away
with the building up of a pattern altogether, and depended
entirely on the excellence in design and workmanship
of the stamp. Mr Weale assigns the date 1367
to the earliest panel stamp known to him, produced by
a certain Lambertus de Insula at Louvain, but this is
only because the manuscript on which it occurs bears that
date. Without some further evidence I should be inclined
to think this date rather too early, and would not
date any panel stamp before the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the binders of the Low
Countries were the earliest to introduce this style of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
binding, and they produced very excellent work; and
the earliest panel stamps we find in use in England are
Netherlandish in execution, either used in this country
by foreign workmen, who had come over and settled, or
obtained by native binders from abroad. The earliest
stamps were no doubt for the most part of metal, and
therefore practically indestructible, and we know that
they often passed out of the hands of their proper owner
and were used by other binders, even though the name
of their original owner was engraved upon them. As
an example I may mention a book-cover in the Douce
collection in the Bodleian, on which two stamps are impressed
side by side. One has the name John Guilibert,
the other the inscription, “Omnes sancti angeli et archangeli
dei, orate pro nobis. Ioris de Gavere me ligavit
in Gandavo.” A still more marvellous example, and
one almost certainly bound in England, is in the library
of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. It has on the two
covers, besides innumerable dies, no less than nine
panels, two signed Woter Vanduffle, three signed Martinus
de Predio, and four signed Jacobus, illuminator.
The binding almost looks like a sample put out to show
a specimen of every stamp and die in the establishment.
The Woter Vanduffle stamp seems very early. I have
in my own collection an English heraldic manuscript of
about the middle of the fifteenth century or slightly
earlier in its original binding impressed with the two
panels of that binder.</p>

<p>In these earliest panels the inscription nearly always
runs perpendicularly, either in the centre of the panel,
cutting it in two, or at the side of the picture. One
peculiarly distinctive feature of the earliest panels is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
the presence of four indentations, more or less deep and
clearly defined at each corner. These were made most
probably by the heads of the nails by which the metal
plate was affixed to a block before used for stamping.
These four marks never seem to occur in later panels,
which, if they have any, have only two, considerably
larger in size, one at the top and one at the bottom.
It has long been a vexed question as to whether these
stamps were made of metal or of wood, but it is probable
that both materials were used, and that the majority of
English stamps were of wood. As no heat was applied
and the leather treated when it was damp and soft,
a wooden stamp would be sufficiently strong, and I have
found by experiment that soft leather takes an excellent
impression from a wooden block. I have, however, in
my own collection a binding struck from a broken plate,
and the appearance of the break shows clearly that the
stamp must have been of metal.</p>

<p>The earliest definitely English panel stamp is on
a loose binding in Westminster Abbey library. It has
on it the arms of Edward IV, with two small supporting
angels. The rest of the binding is covered with small
dies, one in the shape of a heart, the other a <i>fleur de lys</i>.
It is a great pity that the book which was in this binding
has been lost, as it might have contained some clue
to information about the binding.</p>

<p>Wynkyn de Worde, in spite of his enormous business,
does not seem to have ever used a panel with his name
or device, at least so far not one has been found, but
with other printers and stationers the case is different.
Pynson used two panels. One is a copy of one of his
devices, having his initials on a shield with the helmet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
and crest above, while around all is a floral border. The
other has in the centre a large Tudor rose, surrounded
by intertwined branches of vine leaves and grapes.
This latter panel was a popular one, and several variations
of it are to be found, all of which are probably of
the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>The only copy at present known of the Pynson panel
with his mark was acquired not long ago by the British
Museum. I had known of the existence of the copy for
some time, as it had belonged to a Manchester bookseller
who had described it to me. He had sold the
book, but had no record of the purchaser, and knew
nothing of him further than that he lived in London.
One day while I was working in the Museum a visitor
came in with this identical book and offered it for sale.
The book itself was a copy of the <i>Abridgement of the
Statutes of</i> 1499. Herbert, in his <i>Typographical Antiquities</i>,
describes a copy of the <i>Imitation of Christ</i>,
printed by Pynson, which was in a similar binding, and
perhaps that may still be in existence; but I am sorry
to say that the collectors at the beginning of the
present century ruthlessly destroyed all old bindings,
and would not have anything on their shelves except
bound in morocco or russia by Roger Payne or Charles
Lewis. There is not one single old leather binding in
the whole of the Spencer library, though we know that
many of the books when bought were in their original
covers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f5">
<img src="images/fig5.jpg" alt="binding">
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Binding of Frederick Egmont.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Frederick Egmont, the stationer about whom I spoke
in my last lecture, had several panels. The first has as
its central ornament the Tudor rose, and round it are
vine leaves and grapes. Round the whole is an arabesque
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>floral border containing the initials and mark of Egmont.
This design was common at the time, there being several
other panels almost identical, one of which was used by
Pynson. Another more important panel is an almost
exact copy of the device of Philippe Pigouchet, the
Paris printer. A wild man and woman, standing on
either side of a tree covered with some kind of fruit,
bear in one hand flowering boughs while with the other
they assist in supporting a shield suspended by a belt
from the branches above them. Upon the shield are
Egmont’s mark and initials. The device of the wild
man and woman was for some reason very popular at
this time and for a short period afterwards. It was
used by Bumgart at Cologne, and at Edinburgh by
Walter Chepman and Thomas Davidson. It was used
by Pigouchet and other Parisian printers, and by Peter
Treveris, who printed in Southwark at the sign of the
“Wodows,” and the references to it in colophons are
very numerous. This panel of Egmont’s not only bears
his mark and initials, but is inscribed on the lower
margin, “Fredericus Egmondt me f[ecit].” Three copies
only of this binding are known, a very fine copy at
Caius, a poor copy at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge,
and one in my own collection. Books which are stamped
on the front with this panel generally have on the back
a plainer panel containing three rows of arabesques of
foliage surrounded by a border, having ribbons in the
upper and lower portion inscribed with the names of
the four Evangelists. This panel not infrequently
occurs alone, without Egmont’s signed panel, and may
have been left by him in England when he returned to
France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>Nicholas Lecomte, the other foreign stationer settled
in England in the fifteenth century, and of whom I
spoke in my last lecture, also used panels with his initials
and mark. He had not a pictorial panel, but a formal
one of rather Low Country type. The centre of the
panel is divided into two parts, each containing four
spirals of foliage encircling the figures of beasts and
birds, while around all is a border of grapes and vine
leaves. At the bottom of the border are the initials N.C.,
with a mark which almost exactly corresponds with the
initials and mark found in his device in the books
printed for him. A very fine specimen of this binding
is in the University Library.</p>

<p>The majority of the early panels are pictorial, and in
some cases they are very elaborate and ornamental. The
pair used by a binder whose initials were A. R. are
especially fine. On one side is the salutation of Elisabeth
with the Almighty and the Holy Ghost above, in the top
corners are the Tudor emblems, the rose and portcullis.
Round the whole is a diaper border with a shield in each
corner, one the arms of St George, another of the City
of London, a third with two cross swords, and a fourth
with two cross keys. The panel on the other side has
in the centre St John standing preaching to some
people who sit in the foreground. On the left is
St James, on the right King David, while the lower
part is taken up with a picture of David and Bathsheba.
This binding is very rare, and I know of only two
examples, one in my own collection and one in the
University Library. This binder had several other
panels; there is one in the University Library with
a figure of St Roche, and there are two on a book at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
Aberdeen with the Baptism of Christ, and the Annunciation.</p>

<p>It is curious that the subjects of these panels
should have been invariably religious, scenes from the
Bible or pictures of saints, and that we never find
subjects from popular stories. The most frequent
subject of all was, I think, the Annunciation, and then
single figures of saints, St Barbara being one of the
most popular. The binder very often used a panel
with a figure of the saint after whom he was named.
Nicolas Spering, who worked at Cambridge, has a panel
with the picture of St Nicholas restoring to life the
three children who had been killed and pickled by the
innkeeper. Another binding which is probably English,
though it might be French, has on one side St
Barbara with her palm branch and three-windowed
tower, and on the other the Mass of St Gregory. In
the border there occurs a delightful little figure of a
mermaid with a comb in one hand and a looking-glass
in the other.</p>

<p>About 1500 a particular pair of panels came into
great vogue amongst the bookbinders. One had upon
it the arms of England, supported by the dragon and
greyhound, the other the Tudor rose supported by
angels. Round the rose runs a ribbon with the
motto:—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Haec rosa virtutis de celo missa sereno</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Eternum florens regia sceptra feret.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>In the top corners we generally find shields with the
arms of St George and of London, while in the base
below the rose or shield occur the initials and marks of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
the binders. This general use of the royal arms
together with the use of the arms of London points, I
think, to some trade guild to which these binders
belonged. Foreigners, though they might still use the
royal arms, do not use the City arms, putting something
else in the place, sometimes the French shield, sometimes
merely an unmeaning ornament. It is a very
popular but erroneous opinion held by a great many
people that these bindings with the royal arms were
produced for the king, Henry VII or Henry VIII as the
case may be. It would be just as reasonable to imagine
that all the shops with the royal arms over the door
were private residences of the king. Of course, the
fiction is kept up in order to increase the price of the
books; “from the library of Henry VIII” looks well in
catalogues. Even in the sumptuous work recently issued
on the historic bookbindings in the Royal Library at
Windsor this mistake has been repeated.</p>

<p>A very large number of these bindings exist, all
very similar; but unfortunately, although in many cases
they bear the binder’s initials and mark, we cannot
discover his name; on the other hand again we know
the names of many binders, but we cannot identify
their work; the mere fact that the initials on a binding
agree with the initials of a binder’s name does not of
necessity determine that the particular binding was
produced by that binder; a good deal more proof is
necessary.</p>

<p>A certain number of these bindings have been
settled as the work of a certain man in another way.
When the binder was a printer, or a stationer of
sufficient importance to have books printed for him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
then we can identify the mark on his bindings by means
of the mark used in the books.</p>

<p>For instance, to take an early example. We have
bindings by Julian Notary, the printer, which bear his
initials and mark, and the mark, of course, is the same
as the one he uses in his books, while in them his name
is in full. So again the work of Henry Jacobi, an
important London stationer of the early sixteenth
century, was traced by the mark which he uses in some
of his books.</p>

<p>We know the names of a considerable number of
early binders from the registers of the grant of letters
of denization and other manuscript sources, but unfortunately
we have no link between them and the
bindings. In this country it was not necessary, as it
was in some parts of the Low Countries, to register the
design of a binding, and though many of the Low
Country bindings look the same, you will find on
examination that the detail varies and each design was
protected.</p>

<p>The binder who is best known in connexion with
these stamped bindings is John Reynes, whose work is
by far the most commonly met with, and who is almost
the only producer of stamped bindings mentioned by any
early bibliographer. His best-known panel is called
“Redemptoris mundi arma,” and consists of all the
emblems of the Passion arranged in a heraldic manner
upon a shield. Reynes was certainly employed as a
binder by Henry VIII, as we know from early accounts,
and so far as I have seen all the copies of the king’s
<i>Assertio septem sacramentorum</i>, which remain in their
original binding, were bound by him. It is fortunate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
that Reynes put his mark and name in one printed
book, otherwise we should not have been able to
identify him as the binder. He had also two very well-executed
panels, one depicting the fight of St George
and the dragon, and the other the Baptism of Christ.</p>

<p>The period during which these panel stamps were
produced in England was roughly the forty years from
1493 to 1534. The passing of the Act against foreign
workmen in the latter year had no doubt a good deal
to do with the falling off of the work, but the invention
of a binding tool called a roll seems to have finally put
an end to the use of the panel. The roll was a tool
made in the form of a wheel, which saved a very great
deal of time in ornamenting the sides of a book, and
which was used very widely in England during the
sixteenth century. At first when the roll was broad and
well cut, as the earliest examples almost always were, it
produced a very satisfactory appearance, but it soon
became narrower and more finely cut, and therefore
showing to much less advantage on the side of a large
book, and finally about the end of the century its use
was almost entirely given up.</p>

<p>Almost the earliest and the finest of the roll bindings
were those produced by the Cambridge stationers.
Nicholas Spering beside his panel had several fine rolls
which contain his initials and mark.</p>

<p>Naturally the foreign booksellers who sent books
over to England found it to their advantage to put
them into popular bindings, such as would attract
purchasers, and many of these bindings have a distinctly
English character. The exploits of St George and
St Michael are favourite subjects, and are often treated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
in a most decorative manner. There is one specially
fine example dating from about 1500, and probably
Rouen work, which has St George on one side and St
Michael on the other. The binder has not put his
initials, but his device, which occurs on one side, is a
head on a crowned shield. It is worth noticing that
the material of which these foreign bindings are made is
often sheepskin rather than calf, which is nearly
always used in English work. One binder, whose
initials were A. H. and who used the Tudor rose,
though without the arms of London, produced very
good work, but almost always on this sheepskin, which
was not a suitable leather for giving a clear impression.</p>

<p>It is very interesting to watch how in the later panel
bindings the lettering gradually deteriorated and
became simply part of the ornament. I have three
panels, all copied one from the other, and in the first
the legend running round the panel is quite clear and
correct. In the second the letters are confused, though
the general appearance of each separate word is
preserved and they can be read. In the last example
letters and words are all run together, and the general
result is wholly unreadable.</p>

<p>So, too, the old style of work with the pictures of
saints or Biblical scenes was given up about 1530 for
bad Renaissance patterns of pillars and classical heads,
which are so uninteresting, not to say ugly, that we can
hardly regret the speedy disuse of the panel stamp.</p>

<p>Now it must always be remembered that in England
at any rate very few of these early bindings are signed,
and that therefore to assign particular bindings to
particular men is not often possible, but comparison<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
may enable us to attribute them to particular districts,
and even to particular places. What is wanted is that
every small point about these bindings should be
studied carefully and compared in different examples,
because it is mainly by circumstantial evidence that
we can arrive at any knowledge about them. We must
class our bindings by a system similar to that lately
adopted for identifying criminals. The presence or
absence of one particular point merely divides a number
of bindings into two divisions. This point, taken in
conjunction with a second point, narrows the field
immensely, and we can soon put the bindings into
groups more or less accurately.</p>

<p>Anyone who works at all amongst old bindings will
soon begin to note points which are common to certain
bindings, and which most probably mean a certain
thing. For instance, anyone working at the subject
would soon perceive that as a rule octavo or quarto
books in an English binding have three bands to the
back, that is three projecting ridges on which the leaves
are stitched, while foreign bindings have four or more.
Of course this is not an absolute rule but it will be
found correct in nine cases out of ten. To take another
local instance. A very great number of early
Cambridge bindings, and some that may have been
produced at places not far distant, are remarkable for
the curious red colour of the leather used. The binding
has the appearance of having been painted over with red,
and then the red almost all rubbed off again. This is
probably caused by some peculiarity in the process of
tanning or dressing. Whenever I see this curious red
colour I promptly put down the binding as a Cambridge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
one, and a more careful examination generally proves it
to be correct.</p>

<p>If the boards of the binding have a groove running
down the edge you may be fairly certain that the book
inside is printed in Greek. If a binding has four clasps,
one at the top and bottom as well as two in their usual
place, you may be sure that the binding is Italian.
Most of these old bindings had clasps or ties of ribbon
to keep them shut, but in nearly all cases these have
disappeared, and the reason is this. In the early times
books were always put on the shelves back first and
with the fore edge to the front, on which was written
the title of the book. Naturally, when readers wanted
to take down a book they pulled at it by the clasp or
ribbon till that came off, just as now-a-days when books
are placed backs outwards the ordinary reader pulls
them out by the top of the back, till that comes off. In
many cases the ribbons were of alternate colours, a
white opposite a green and a green opposite a white.
Of course as soon as books were put in the shelves with
the backs outwards the use of ribbons was discontinued,
for it was awkward to push into its place a book with
two large bows of ribbon in front. The use of ribbons
you will notice has been lately revived by some faddists
who have no sense of the fitness of things.</p>

<p>These bindings that we have been considering were
of course what we should call trade bindings or
publishers’ bindings. Very few people seem to have
had books especially bound for them, and those kind of
bindings had generally gilded ornaments upon them,
which are not found on early stamped work. The
custom of impressing coats of arms on books did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
begin until about 1535, when it was started by some
Scottish collectors, the earliest known armorial stamp
having been used by William Stewart, Bishop of
Aberdeen.</p>

<p>The books specially bound for Henry VIII were
ornamented in what was called the Venetian manner,
that is with tools obtained perhaps from Venice, but
clearly cut in imitation of those used by Aldus for his
bindings; the binder of these books was the well-known
stationer, Thomas Berthelet.</p>

<p>While these bindings and their designs afford
valuable bibliographical information, the materials
employed in making the bindings are also often of
great importance. The boards were often made of
refuse printed leaves pasted together, and were always
lined, after the binding was completed, with leaves of
paper or vellum, printed or manuscript. To show you
how important these fragments may be, I may mention
that of the books printed in England or for England in
the fifteenth century no less than fifty-three are known
only from fragments obtained from bindings. The
great find of Caxton fragments made by Blades at
St Alban’s I have mentioned before. Not long ago I
took to pieces the boards of a primer of Edward VI and
obtained the title and some other leaves of Constable’s
<i>Epigrams</i>, printed by Pynson in 1520, and of which but
one perfect copy is known, four leaves of a Whitinton’s
<i>Grammar</i> printed by W. de Worde, eight leaves of an
early <i>Abridgement of the Statutes</i>, probably printed by
Middleton, a perfect copy of an unknown edition of the <i>Ordynaunce
made in the time of ye reygne of kynge Henry VI
to be observed in the Kynge’s Eschequier by the offycers</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
<i>and clerkes of the same for takyng of fees of ye kynges
accomptis in the same courts</i>, printed by Middleton, and
last an unknown broadside ballad relating to the
burning of Robert Barnes in 1540, printed for Richard
Bankes by that little-known printer, John Redman,
who put his name only to one or at the most two
known books.</p>

<p>From a binding in Westminster Abbey some years
ago came two leaves of an unknown early Cambridge
book, Lily’s <i>De octo orationis partium constructione</i>,
edited by Erasmus, and lately at Oxford Mr Proctor
found in a binding in New College some fragments of a
<i>Donatus Melior</i> on vellum, printed by Caxton, a hitherto
unknown book. As Bradshaw said over twenty years
ago: “It cannot be any matter of wonder that the
fragments used for lining the boards of old books should
have an interest for those who make a study of the
methods and habits of our early printers with a view to
the solution of some of many difficulties still remaining
unsettled in the history of printing. I have for many
years tried to draw the attention of librarians and
others to the evidence which may be gleaned from a
careful study of these fragments; and if done systematically
and intelligently it ceases to be mere antiquarian
pottering or aimless waste of time.”</p>

<p>Of course the majority of fragments found in bindings
are of no value, and should not be moved; indeed,
fragments should never be taken out of bindings unless
it is absolutely necessary, for by doing so the binding is
almost certain to suffer some injury.</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>To study effectively the early English book a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
knowledge about these early bindings is required, for
the printer, as we have seen, was probably his own
binder. What I said about the stationers applies also
to the binders, their history is an almost unworked
subject, new details are found from time to time, but we
have no work on the subject to which we can add them,
and our knowledge at present consists mostly of isolated
facts. Bradshaw, writing twenty years ago, spoke of
the subject as still in its infancy, and I am afraid that
English bibliographers cannot boast of much progress.
This is not, perhaps, to be much wondered at when we
consider how few are willing to work on in the steady,
quiet way which he practised and taught. We can do
no better than follow in the path that he pointed out,
add fact to fact, and detail to detail, avoiding vain
theories and idle speculations, so that whatever advance
we make in our knowledge of the subject, whether it be
much or little, it may at any rate be accurate, and serve
as a secure foundation for the work of the future.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">LECTURE V.</h2>


<p class="c sp">WYNKYN DE WORDE AND THE POPULAR PRINTERS.</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">In</span> the four lectures which I had the privilege of
giving as Sandars Reader in the Lent term of 1899
I dealt with the printers, stationers, and bookbinders of
London and Westminster in the fifteenth century. In
the present series I propose to continue their history
up to the year 1535.</p>

<p>The date which has been fixed upon is not a purely
arbitrary one, but has been chosen for two reasons. In
the first place, it is the year in which Wynkyn de Worde,
by far the most important and prolific of all the early
English printers, died, and secondly, it just includes and
allows us to examine the remarkable change brought
about in the English book trade by the passing of the
Act relating to printers in the twenty-fifth year of
Henry VIII, which came into force on Christmas-Day,
1534.</p>

<p>Though Westminster was joined with London in
the earlier lectures, it ceased after 1500 to have any
printers of its own, for in that year De Worde moved
to London to be nearer the centre of trade, and he was
followed almost immediately by Julian Notary. In this
lecture I am going to take, besides De Worde, all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
printers and stationers who were connected with him
in business, and who formed what might be called the
popular school of printers, who neglecting legal, political,
and learned books, such as were issued by the King’s
Printers, confined their attention to books of a lighter
and more ephemeral kind.</p>

<p>Wynkyn de Worde, who had probably been an
assistant of Caxton’s from the time of the introduction
of printing into England in 1476, was certainly married
and settled in Westminster by 1480, in which year his
wife Elizabeth is mentioned in a deed. He inherited
all Caxton’s printing material and continued to lease
his old house and printing-office from the Abbot of
Westminster, John Esteney, in whose account-book he
is entered from the year 1491 onward. Mr Scott, of
the British Museum, who first made known these entries,
which he had found when calendaring the Abbey
muniments, noted that he was called Jan Wynkyn in
them, and wrote a letter to the <i>Athenaeum</i> to point out
that the printer’s Christian name, hitherto unknown, was
John. It appears to me that about this name there is
some confusion or mistake.</p>

<p>Wijnand or Wynkyn is itself a Christian name, and
De Worde like most other foreign printers made use of
his Christian name joined to the name of the place from
which he came. Thus we have Joannes Lettou (John
of Lithuania), Willelmus de Machlinia (William of
Malines), Jan van Doesborch, Christopher van Ruremond,
John Siberch, and so on, while we have no example
of a surname joined with the name of a place. In all
the hundreds of colophons to De Worde’s books, in his
patent of denization, even in his will, there is no hint of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
such a name as Jan, and the combination Jan Wynkyn
could only mean John the son of Wynkyn. We must
presume that De Worde knew better than the Abbot
what his own name was and that the Abbot’s entry is
the result of some confusion. I am the more anxious
to point out this confusion about the name because
entirely without my knowledge and after I had returned
my last proof the editor of the <i>Dictionary of National
Biography</i> inserted this piece of information, extracted
from Mr Scott’s letter, in my notice of Wynkyn de
Worde, and thus made me responsible for a statement
which I do not in the least believe.</p>

<p>De Worde continued to print in Caxton’s house
until some time in 1500, when he moved to the sign of
the Sun in Fleet Street. The position of the house
can be settled almost exactly. It is described as over
against, that is, opposite the Conduit, and this was
situated in Fleet Street, just where Shoe Lane entered
it on the north side. De Worde’s house being in
St Bride’s parish and near the church must have been
on the south side of the street and therefore opposite
the entrance of Shoe Lane. He rented two houses, one
no doubt a dwelling-house, the other his printing-office,
and for these he paid a rent of sixty-six shillings and
eight-pence. On leaving Westminster De Worde either
destroyed or parted with a considerable portion of his
printing material. Some of his type used up to this
time never appears again, and many of the wood blocks
used to illustrate his books are found in the hands of
other printers, more especially Julian Notary.</p>

<p>The year 1501 was apparently mostly taken up with
settling into his new premises; for this year his output<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
was the smallest during his whole career, and we know
of but one dated book issued in it, a new edition of
Bishop Alcock’s <i>Mons Perfectionis</i> which appeared on
May 27. Three copies of this book are known, in the
libraries of Peterborough and Lincoln Cathedrals, and
the third in the University Library, which came in the
bequest of Mr Sandars.</p>

<p>On April 22, 1502, De Worde issued an edition of
the <i>Manipulus Curatorum</i>, which is worthy of notice.
It is a very small octavo, printed in a small neat black-letter,
and all the copies I have seen, with one exception,
have on the title-page the small square early device of
the printer. The copy, however, which belonged to
Richard Farmer and is now in the Bodleian, has a device
of De Worde which so far as I know is found in no other
book. It is, like his most common device, divided into
three parts. The upper contains the sun, two planets,
and thirty-six stars, the middle Caxton’s mark and
initials, and the lower the unicorn and Sagittarius above
a ribbon containing De Worde’s name in full. The
engraver has made a not uncommon mistake and has
engraved the large initial <i>C</i> so that it prints the wrong
way about. Another device of De Worde’s had the
mark reversed, but that was not so obvious an error; in
this case the printer seems to have thought the mistake
too flaring and to have suppressed the device.</p>

<p>There is a curious little undated tract in the University
Library which cannot be later than the beginning
of 1502, describing the doings of Margerie Kempe of
Lynn, a religious enthusiast who travelled about the
country with an axe asking people to cut her head off.
In this De Worde used, probably for the last time, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>beautiful cut of the Crucifixion which he had inherited
from Caxton, but which beginning to split in 1499 had
now broken in half and was in other ways more or less
damaged.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f6">
<img src="images/fig6.jpg" alt="device">
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Unrecorded device of W. de Worde.</span></p>
</div>

<p>In 1504 De Worde began the use of his best known
device, first used in a <i>Grammar</i> of Sulpitius, of which
the unique copy is in the library of Shrewsbury School.
It is square in shape and divided into three parts. In
the upper are the sun, two planets, and twenty stars, in
the middle Caxton’s initials and mark, and in the lower
the printer’s name on a ribbon, above which are a dog
and a centaur. This device was used until 1518, when
having got cracked and broken it was replaced by an
almost exact facsimile. This in its turn was used until
1528, when it was replaced by a third copy. So similar
to the eye are these three varieties that no writer on
bibliography has noticed the differences, though they
form the most valuable date test we have for De
Worde’s books, as it was this device he most generally
used.</p>

<p>Towards the end of 1508 when Pynson was appointed
printer to the King, De Worde appears to have received
some sort of official appointment as printer to the
Countess of Richmond and Derby, the King’s mother.
He had printed several books before this time at her
request, a phrase which I suppose meant that she had
helped to defray the cost, but he had not called himself
specially her printer. In most of the books printed in
1509 before the 29th June, when the Countess died, he
gives himself an official title, as printer to the King’s
mother.</p>

<p>Among the books printed in 1508 is one entitled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
<i>The Book of Kerving</i>, of which there were several editions.
A copy of one of these editions, which was in the
collection of Rawlinson, contained the following rhyme
in an old hand,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Wynken de Worde</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sate at the borde</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wyth hys cosyn forde</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And kyld hym with a sworde.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Below this the learned owner has written “Whether
this last writing be not a whymsy I know not but feare
much it is.”</p>

<p>Two books of 1508 were printed on vellum, Fisher’s
<i>Sermon on the Fruitful Sayings of David</i>, and Richard of
Hampole’s <i>Devout Meditacions</i>, and there are copies of
both in the British Museum.</p>

<p>The year 1509 was a very important one in De
Worde’s life. The death of Henry VII was very soon
followed by that of Margaret, Countess of Richmond
and Derby, De Worde’s special patroness. However,
the output of books this year was the largest of any
year of his life. The royal funerals and the coronation
would no doubt attract large crowds to London and so
encourage business. Out of some thirty books printed
this year I can only trace five as having been issued
before Henry VII’s death, that is roughly during the
first four months of the year. To one of these I should
like to draw your particular attention. It is called
<i>Nicodemus Gospel</i> and there is a copy in the University
Library. Its colophon runs “Enprynted at London in
Flete strete at the sygne of the sonne by wynkyn de
worde, printer unto the moost excellent pryncesse my
lady the Kynges moder. In the yere of our lorde god<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
MCCCCC.ix. the xxiii. daye of Marche.” This colophon
and that to the <i>Golden Legend</i> of 1498 are two of the
proofs we possess that De Worde began his year on
January 1 and not as was very common on March 25. The
book you will notice was issued on March 23, 1509, and
Henry VII and his mother the Countess of Richmond
are both referred to as alive. Had De Worde begun
his year on March 25 and meant by March 23, 1509,
March 23, 1510, both these persons would have been
dead. The point is interesting because the custom of
printers varied, and, as I shall show later, De Worde’s
contemporary Julian Notary dated the other way. In
a few books printed between the death of Henry VII
and that of the Countess of Richmond and Derby
De Worde calls himself printer to the King’s grandmother.</p>

<p>About this time De Worde had a second shop in
St Paul’s Churchyard with the sign of Our Lady
of Pity, but he does not appear to have kept it long
and it is only mentioned in some colophons of this year.
It was perhaps in reference to this sign that in some of
his books he placed at the end a small cut of Our Lady
of Pity in place of his usual device.</p>

<p>The books issued in 1509 were of all kinds. Funeral
sermons on Henry VII and the Countess of Richmond,
congratulatory poems addressed to Henry VIII, and a
very large number of popular poems and stories, among
them such books as <i>Richard Cœur de Lion</i>, <i>The Conversion
of Swearers</i>, <i>The Fifteen Joys of Marriage</i>, <i>The
Parliament of Devils</i>, and Hawes’s <i>Pastime of Pleasure</i>.
Perhaps the most interesting of all is the edition of
Henry Watson’s version of the <i>Ship of Fools</i>. Only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
one copy of this beautiful book is known, which is
printed on vellum and is preserved in the Bibliothèque
Nationale. Henry Watson was an assistant of De
Worde’s and acted partly as printer and partly as
translator. Another book of this year is worth noticing,
the first edition of the York <i>Manual</i>. Though it has
a full and clear colophon stating that it was printed by
De Worde, in fact the statement is repeated twice over,
there can be no doubt that it was printed abroad; the
type both of text and music, the illustrations, the
device, the peculiar size of the paper all go to prove
this.</p>

<p>In 1510 a much smaller number of books, only
about eight, were issued. The printer seems to have
been taking a rest, for he never in any future year
prints so small a number. Two curious books were
issued in this year, <i>King Apolyn of Tyre</i>, and the <i>Birth
of Merlin</i>, and in the following year <i>The Demaundes
Joyous</i>. This delightful though sometimes unedifying
little book of riddles contains specimens which I
remember having been asked as a child, and I suppose
they are asked yet. “How many cows’ tails would
it take to reach the moon?” with the simple answer
“One if it were long enough.” “How many sticks go to
a crow’s nest?” “None, for lack of feet.”</p>

<p>In 1512 appeared the <i>History of Helias, Knight of
the Swan</i>, another book only known from a single copy
printed on vellum, now in the library of Mr Hoe of
New York. One fact about the book is worth noting
for the benefit of future bibliographers and that is that
neither in the catalogue of the sale in which it appeared
nor, consequently, in Mr Hazlitt’s description in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
last volume of <i>Bibliographical Collections and Notes</i>, is
there any reference to the book being printed on vellum.</p>

<p>In 1512 there appeared also the first grammatical
work by Whittinton, whose various books became so
popular that De Worde sometimes issued as many as
four editions of one work in a year. At that time
printers had not enough type to admit of their keeping
it standing for any length of time, and as labour was
very cheap they preferred to reset the type for small
editions and not print off a very large edition, which
perhaps might lie on their hands for a long time.</p>

<p>So many and so varied were the productions of De
Worde’s press—he printed between seven and eight
hundred known books—that it is hard to pick out any
for special notice. In 1515 he issued an edition of the
<i>Way to the Holy Land</i>, which was reprinted in 1524.
In 1516 Capgrave’s <i>Nova Legenda Angliae</i>, of which
a copy on vellum is in the Bibliothèque Nationale.
In 1517 we have <i>Troylus and Cressede</i>; in 1518 <i>Oliver
of Castile</i>. In 1519 the <i>Orchard of Syon</i>, of which
several copies were printed on vellum. In 1521 he
issued a book of <i>Christmas Carolles</i>, of which there is
a fragment in the Bodleian; it contains the well-known
carol,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The bores head in hande bring I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With garlands gay and rosemary</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I pray you all synge merely</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Qui estis in convivio.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>In 1522 an edition of the <i>Mirror of Golde for the
sinful soul</i> appeared with De Worde’s name in the
colophon, but the edition is identical with one issued
simultaneously by John Skot. From the type it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
clear that Skot was the printer, and an examination of
several of De Worde’s books about this time shows that
they were also produced by Skot.</p>

<p>Erasmus begins about this time to be represented
amongst De Worde’s books by his <i>Colloquiorum formulae</i>,
<i>De copia verborum</i>, <i>Good manners for children</i>, and a
few others, but the printer does not seem to have
printed many editions, which is the more remarkable
as the booksellers’ accounts of the time point to
a large demand for Erasmus’ books.</p>

<p>In 1530 appeared the <i>Book of Songs</i>, of which there
is a copy in the British Museum, and it is the first
genuine music-book printed by De Worde. The book
contained songs for four and three parts, but the one
volume known contains the bass only. From this time
onwards most of the printer’s work was confined to
reprinting earlier editions, and only about one in twenty
were new books; a good deal of his work was done by
other printers, as can be seen from the type, and in the
last few years we find him printing books for other
people. For his old apprentice John Byddell he printed
four or five books in 1533 and 1534, two editions of
Erasmus’ <i>Enchiridion Militis Christiani</i>, a <i>Life of
Hyldebrande</i>, and another work.</p>

<p>His last book was curiously enough a little poem, <i>The
Complaint of the too soon maryed</i>. I do not know whether
he considered it applicable to his own case, but his own
marriage had taken place more than 55 years before.</p>

<p>De Worde died apparently at the very beginning of
1535, for his will dated June 5, 1534, was proved on the
19th January following. It is much to be regretted that
this most valuable document has never been reprinted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
in full, for both the published abstracts (Herbert’s
<i>Ames</i>, 119, 120, and Plomer’s <i>Abstract of Wills</i>, 3, 4)
omit important names. To each of his apprentices,
who are not named, he leaves books to the value of
three pounds. To Robert Darby, Robert Maas, John
Barbanson, Hector, Simon [Simon Martynson?], John
Wislyn, and Alard, a bookbinder, bequests are left, and
they are described as servants, that is people who were
then working for him, either apprentices who had
served their full time or journeymen. John Butler,
James Gaver, and John Byddell are each described as
“late my servant.” Besides these, legacies were left
to Henry Pepwell, John Gowghe, and Robert Copland,
and “Nowell the bokebinder in Shoo lane.” This latter
was a certain Noël Havy, a Frenchman who came to
England in 1523, married an English wife, became a
denizen, and continued in business until after 1550.
John Byddell and James Gaver were made executors
and continued to live and carry on business in his
house.</p>

<p>De Worde’s wife had long been dead, and no
children, if he had any, seem to have survived him.
He ordered his executors to purchase land in or near
London which should produce at least twenty shillings
a year to be given to St Bride’s Church to keep an obit
for his soul, and we learn from the Survey of Chantries
made in February 1547 that the sum thus expended was
thirty-six pounds. Of De Worde’s work as a bookbinder
we know little. He inherited the binding tools
which had belonged to Caxton, and there are several
bindings on which these are used, notably, a very fine
example in the library of Corpus Christi College, Oxford,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
which can with certainty be ascribed to him. Early in
the sixteenth century, when panel stamps were generally
used, Caxton’s dies seem to have been parted with, but
we cannot at present point to any panel as having been
used by De Worde. It will be noticed, however, that
the three binders mentioned in the will, Alard, who was
then in his employment, James Gaver, a former assistant,
and the independent workman Noël Havy of Shoe Lane
were all foreigners, and therefore most probably used
their own panels of foreign design.</p>

<p>James Gaver belonged to a well-known family of
Low Country binders and would doubtless use panels
similar to theirs. When we find early printed English
books in their original bindings it is fairly safe to
assume these bindings to have been executed in
England, for there could have been practically no
exportation of such books, and we know of a considerable
number stamped with distinctly Netherlandish
panels. This James Gaver continued to live with
Byddell after De Worde’s death at the sign of the Sun
and issued one book with his name, an edition of
Stanbrydge’s <i>Accidence</i> from that address in 1539.
Whether or no this book was really printed by him is
uncertain; for it is identical, with the exception of the
colophon, with an edition printed nominally by Nicolas
Bourman. At the end of Gaver’s edition is a very rude
woodcut of the Sun (used as a printer’s device and
referring to the sign of the shop), which had been used
previously by Lawrence Andrewe in his edition of the
<i>Mirrour of the World</i>.</p>

<p>Gaver had taken out letters of denization on March
2, 1535 in which he is described as James Gaver,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
stationer, from the dominion of the Emperor. In 1541
he is entered in the Returns of Aliens and pays a tax of
£1. 7<i>s.</i> He died in 1545 and his will was proved on
June 15. He there calls himself a bookseller and
requested that he might be buried in St Bride’s Church,
before the altar of St Catherine, “neare unto Wynkyn
de Worde sometyme my master.” The overseer to the
will was William Stewarde, a stationer, his son-in-law.</p>

<p>Julian Notary, who had been printing in Westminster
since 1497, moved soon after 1500 into St
Clement’s parish, just outside Temple Bar. He appears
to have taken possession of the shop lately vacated by
Pynson, which during the latter’s tenancy seems to have
had no sign. By Notary it was given the sign of the
Three Kings. The first dated book from this new
address was an edition of the <i>Golden Legend</i> issued in
February 1504. Just as from the very full colophon of
the preceding edition issued by W. de Worde in 1498 it
is clearly proved that De Worde began his year on the
first of January, so from the colophon of this edition
we can prove that Notary did the opposite and began
his year on the twenty-fifth of March. It runs as
follows. “Whyche werke I dyde accomplysshe and
fynysshe at Tempell barr the xvi daye of Feverer. The
yere of oure lorde a Thousande ccccciii. And in the
xix yere of the reygne of kynge Henry the vii. By
me Julyan Notary. Thys emprynted at Temple Barre
by me Julyan Notary.” Now the 16th of February
19 Henry VII was 1504 in our ordinary computation, so
that Notary clearly did not end his year until March 24.
This <i>Golden Legend</i> contains a very curious and mixed
collection of illustrations. Some had belonged to W.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
de Worde and some to Caxton. There are besides five
metal engravings in the “<i>manière criblée</i>,” obtained
doubtless from abroad, and some curious engraved initial
letters which had apparently belonged to André Bocard.
It would be exceedingly interesting could we trace the
history of these <i>criblée</i> cuts and discover whence Notary
obtained them. The designs were clearly taken from a
set of compositions the work of a Lower Rhine engraver
about 1450-60, known as the “master of St Erasmus,”
of which a complete set may be found in the British
Museum. Notary’s, however, are not direct copies but
probably imitations of some <i>criblée</i> prints copied from
the original designs. Such sets are at Munich and
Berlin, and another of a similar class may be found in
the editions of the <i>Horologium Devotionis</i>, printed at
Cologne by Ulric Zel about 1490, and John Landen,
a few years later. Notary’s are very exact copies from
these, but engraved the reverse way, a common
occurrence in copies.</p>

<p>In 1507 Notary issued a very curious book, the first
edition of <i>Nicodemus Gospel</i>, which I mention here
slightly out of its turn as it contains three more <i>criblée</i>
cuts and is the only other book except the <i>Chronicles of
England</i> in which they are found. Only one copy of
the book is known and its history is interesting. It
appeared in the auction catalogue (p. 354) of Richard
Smith’s books, sold in 1682, bound up in a volume
of tracts, and after the sale it disappeared. On the
authority of the catalogue it was mentioned by successive
bibliographers, but no one had seen it and its
whereabouts was unknown. I was beginning to think
that it never existed and that the entry in Smith’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
catalogue was founded on a mistake, when to my delight,
on a recent visit to Dublin, I found the identical volume
in Archbp. Marsh’s library. It had been bought at
Smith’s sale in 1682 by Bishop Stillingfleet, and the
whole of his library of printed books was bought at
his death by Marsh and transported to Dublin. As
Marsh’s library has never had a printed catalogue and
has not been much used, its contents are very little
known, though I am glad to say a catalogue of the Early
English books is about to be printed. Besides the
<i>Golden Legend</i>, Notary printed in 1504 an edition of
the <i>Chronicles of England</i>, and a now lost edition of the
Sarum <i>Hymns and Sequences</i> of which he issued
another edition in the following year.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 1508 an edition of the <i>Scala
Perfectionis</i> appeared, and the copy described by Herbert
is similar to the one which came to the University
Library with Mr Sandars’s collection. Herbert describes
his as in an original binding with Notary’s mark, and
the one bequeathed by Mr Sandars is similarly bound.</p>

<p>In 1510 Notary issued an edition of the <i>Sermones
discipuli</i> by John Herolt having on the title-page a very
interesting imprint which, translated, runs as follows,
“These [<i>i.e.</i> the Sermons] are to be sold (where they
have been printed) at London in the suburb of Temple
Bar near the porch of St Clements in the house of
Julian Notary, printer and bookseller, carrying on
business under the sign of the Three Kings. And they
will also be found for sale in St Paul’s Churchyard at
the same man’s little shop [cellula] from which also
hangs the same sign of the Three Kings.” Apparently
a sign was personal property and could be moved by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
owner if he moved to another shop. If, however, he became
possessed, on the death of the earlier owner, of a
shop with a well-known sign, he would retain it in
preference to his own. As an example of the first case
we find Rastell giving the sign of the Mermaid to three
successive places of business. On the other hand when
Byddell succeeded De Worde, he did not transfer his
own sign Our Lady of Pity, but retained De Worde’s
well known sign of the Sun.</p>

<p>What Notary was doing between 1510 and 1515
is unknown, but during that period he issued no dated
book. One thing, however, is clear. He had given up
his printing-office in the Strand and had moved to a
house in St Paul’s Churchyard with the sign of St Mark,
and there he issued in 1515 another edition of the
<i>Chronicles of England</i>. Though the sign is not
mentioned the address is very clear. “Dwelling in Paul’s
churchyard beside the west door by my lord’s palace.”
In 1516 he was mentioned as living at the sign of St
Mark at the west door. This sign, however, did not
please him, and by 1518 he had replaced it with the
old sign of the Three Kings. That these two signs
succeeded each other on the same house and did not
refer to two different houses is I think clear from the
wording of the following two colophons. “Imprinted
in London in Poules chyrche yarde at the weste Doore
besyde my lorde of London’s palase. At the sygne of
saynt Marke”; and “Inprinted in London ... in Paules
chirche yarde at the weste dore besyde my lorde of
london’s palayse, at the sign of the thre kynges.”</p>

<p>Among Notary’s undated books is a very curious
little tract called <i>A merry gest and a true howe Johan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
Splynter made his testament</i>. The only copy known is
in the library of Britwell Court. It begins on the verso
of the first leaf,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">This Johan Splynter as every man tell can</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was the Rentgatherer of Delft and Sceydam.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>On the title is a curious woodcut which occurs also
on another small tract, the <i>Mery geste of a Sergeaunt
and Frere</i>.</p>

<p>The best known of Notary’s books is his edition of
the <i>Shepherdes Calendar</i>, a curious medley of matter
which was first printed in a translation at Paris by
Verard in 1503. That translation was made by a
Scotchman who knew very little French, so that the
result is rather peculiar. The book was revised and
printed by Pynson in 1508 and also later by Wynkyn
de Worde. In the only known copy of Notary’s edition
the colophon is mutilated and the date partly destroyed,
but as it was printed in Paul’s Churchyard at the Three
Kings the date may be safely fixed at about 1518.</p>

<p>Notary made use of two panel stamps on his bindings.
One contains in the centre a Tudor rose round
which run two ribbons supported by angels. On the
ribbons is the motto</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Hec rosa virtutis de celo missa sereno</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Eternum florens regia sceptra feret.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>In the upper corners are shields with the cross of St
George and the arms of the City of London, while below
the rose are the binder’s mark and initials. The other
panel contains an escutcheon bearing the arms of
England and France quartered, ensigned with a royal
crown and supported by a dragon and greyhound; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
arms of St George and the City of London are in the
upper corners.</p>

<p>Of these two panels there are two varieties differing
in minor details. They may readily be distinguished
by the N in the device, which in the rarer variety has
the cross stroke the wrong way.</p>

<p>Robert Copland was for many years an assistant to
Wynkyn de Worde, and some have suggested even to
Caxton himself from the ambiguous use of the word
“master” in the prologue to <i>King Apolyn of Tyre</i>,
where he speaks of himself as “gladly followynge the
trace of my mayster Caxton.” As Copland did not die
before 1548 it is very improbable, though not impossible,
that he could have worked under Caxton at Westminster.
As an assistant to De Worde he translated a
considerable number of popular books from the French
and edited others, often adding quaint introductions
or prefatory verses. About 1514 he appears to have
started in business on his own account, for some copies
of the <i>Dying Creature</i> printed by W. de Worde in that
year have his device on the last leaf. This consists of
his mark and initials on a shield hanging from a tree
and surrounded by a garland of roses and supported by
a stag and hind. Round it is the text from Proverbs
xxii., “Melius est nomen bonum quam divitie multe.”
Like many English devices of the time it is copied from
a French one. The garland round the shield refers to
the sign of his shop the Rose Garland in Fleet Street,
though the first book from this address was not issued
until later. A small law-book issued about this time,
though it contains his name and device was issued
from De Worde’s house, the Sun. In 1515 he began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
work at the Rose Garland and issued a book called the
<i>Justice of Peace</i>, of which a copy is in the Cambridge
University Library. His next dated book was Barclay’s
<i>Introductory to French</i>, and after this there is a gap of
seven years. Altogether before 1535 he printed only
some twelve books. The explanation of this is, I
believe, that his press was largely subsidised by De
Worde. Many books issued by De Worde have
prefatory or ending verses written by “Robert Copland
the book-printer,” and most bibliographers have therefore
rashly asserted that they must be reprints of
editions which he had previously issued. Copland
printed entire editions for De Worde and therefore they
contain De Worde’s name and address, but Copland as
their printer added his introduction.</p>

<p>Another point which seems to prove his dependence
on De Worde is that after the latter’s death in 1535 up
to about 1547 we have no trace of Copland printing at
all. He continued to translate and revise for others
but the only reference to him as a practical printer is to
be found in Andrew Borde’s <i>Pryncyples of Astronomye</i>
printed about 1548, in which the author speaks of
his <i>Introduction to Knowledge</i> as “now a pryntyng at
old Robert Copland’s the eldest printer of England.”
As this book was finished and issued by William
Copland, it may be presumed that Robert died about
1548.</p>

<p>Henry Pepwell, who worked at the sign of the
Trinity in St Paul’s Churchyard, was a native of
Birmingham. Of his life we know nothing before the
year 1518, when he issued an edition of the <i>Castle of
Pleasure</i>. In 1520 he printed an edition of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
<i>Christiani Hominis Institutum</i>, a translation into Latin
verse by Erasmus of a little tract by Colet. In this
he made use of a device which had belonged to his
predecessor at the sign of the Trinity, a stationer named
Henry Jacobi, but with the name Jacobi erased from
the block. Between 1518 and 1523 Pepwell printed
eight books, and their rarity may be gauged from the
fact that two are only known from fragments, four from
single copies, and of the remaining two there are in one
case two copies, in the other four.</p>

<p>Pepwell must have been a leading member of the
trade, for in 1525 he was appointed, together with
Lewis Sutton, a warden of the Company of Stationers.
He was a friend of Stokeslay, the Bishop of London,
and of his agent Thomas Dockwray, who was afterwards
the first warden of the new Stationers’ Company. In
1531 he issued an edition of Eckius’ <i>Enchiridion
locorum communium adversus Lutheranos</i>, printed for
him at Antwerp by Michael Hillenius. Bale in one of
his works mentions this book as follows “No lesse
myght harrye pepwell in Paules church yearde have out
of Michael Hillenius howse at Antwerp at one tyme
than a whole complete prynte at the holye request of
Stokyslaye. In a short space were they dyspached and
a newe prynte in hande, soche tyme as he also commaunded
Barlowes dyaloges to be preached of the
curates through out all hys dyocese.” The existence of
this book was for long doubtful until I finally found the
title-page in one of the volumes of Bagford’s collections
and shortly afterwards I found a perfect copy which
had belonged to Latimer in the library of Westminster
Abbey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>Pepwell as an important bookseller and good Catholic
was probably of great assistance to the authorities in
their crusade against heretical books. In 1533 Vaughan
writes to Cromwell, “The Bishop of London, Stokeslay,
has had a servant [Dockwray] in Antwerp this fortnight.
If you send for Henry Pepwell, a stationer in
Paul’s Churchyard, who was often with him, he will tell
you his business.”</p>

<p>In 1535 he received by the will of W. de Worde a
legacy of four pounds in printed books. In 1539 he
issued two grammars of Lily for the use of St Paul’s
School, but though he is clearly stated in the imprint
to have been the printer, there is very little doubt that
they were printed at Antwerp. The only copies known
of these grammars are bound up with some others
by Colet in a small volume now in the Pepysian
Library bought by Pepys at Richard Smith’s sale in
1682.</p>

<p>In October, 1539, Pepwell, accompanied by William
Bonham and Henry Tab, was sent by Cromwell to St
Albans to inquire about a heretical book which had
been issued from the press there. This I believe to
have been a hitherto unknown and unique book “<i>A
very declaration of the bond and free will of man</i>”
issued at St Albans without date or name of printer.
The printer was however John Herford, who came to
London, in custody of the three stationers to be dealt
with by Cromwell.</p>

<p>Pepwell died at the beginning of 1541 and his will
was proved on the 8th February, William Bonham the
printer being one of the supervisors. Two-thirds of his
property was left to Ursula his wife and the remaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
third to his children, who were all under age and are
not mentioned by name, though no doubt the Arthur
Pepwell who was afterwards a member of the Stationers’
Company was one.</p>

<p>John Skot commenced to print in 1521, and issued
on May 17 <i>the Body of Policy</i>, of which there is a
copy on vellum in the Cambridge University Library.
At this time he was living in St Sepulchre’s parish
without Newgate and printed there six books. The
<i>Mirror of Gold for the Sinful Soul</i>, the <i>History of Jacob
and his twelve sons</i>, the <i>Book of maid Emlyn</i>, and two
law tracts. In these is found his first device, having
his mark and initials on a shield surmounted by a
helmet and supported by two dragons. He used a fount
of narrow black-letter, and it is clear that besides his
own books he printed several for De Worde.</p>

<p>His next move was to St Paul’s Churchyard, where
he printed eight books, but only two are dated, the
<i>Commendations of Matrimony</i> of 1528 and <i>Nicodemus
Gospel</i> of 1529. Besides these there were three law
tracts, two grammars, and an edition of <i>Every Man</i>.
At this address he began to use a device, exactly copied
down to the misprint in the motto, from one used at
Paris by Denis Rosse, but so carelessly cut that both his
name and monogram are printed backwards. He also
made use of his first device with his monogram inserted
on the shield in place of his mark. Either before or after
his residence in St Paul’s Churchyard, but probably
before, he printed an edition of Stanbridge’s <i>Accidence</i>
“Without Bishopsgate in saint Botolphs parish at
George Alley gate.”</p>

<p>In 1531 John Toy issued an edition of the <i>Gradus</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
<i>comparationum</i> which has Skot’s device at the end and
was probably printed by him, though his name is not
mentioned. By 1537 he had moved to Fauster Lane in
St Leonard’s parish, but before this he had got into
trouble over a book of which apparently no fragment
remains. This publication was an outcome of the
extraordinary religious troubles connected with the
impostures of Elizabeth Barton, the Maid of Kent,
which were put down by Cranmer, and the maid and
her associates executed in 1533. Amongst the documents
connected with the case was the confession of
the printer, and Cranmer entered among his notes “to
remember that Dr Bokking did put unto Skotte all the
Nun’s book to print and had five hundred of them
when they were printed and the printer two hundred.”
This perhaps refers to a tract entitled “<i>A miraculous
work of late done at Court of Strete in Kent, published
to the devoute people of this tyme for their spiritual
consolation by Edward Thwaytes, Gent.</i>,” of which some
manuscript copies exist.</p>

<p>At Fauster Lane Skot printed one book the <i>Rosary</i>,
dated 1537, and five undated books, <i>The Golden Litany</i>,
<i>Nicodemus Gospel</i>, <i>The Nut-browne Maide</i>, <i>The Book of
Herbs</i>, and <i>The Battle of Agincourt</i>. After 1537 we
have no trace of him.</p>

<p>Several writers have supposed that he may have
been the same person as a printer of the same name
who appeared at Edinburgh in 1539, and passed an
adventurous career in that town and at St Andrews up
to about the year 1571. There seems nothing to
support the theory beyond the similarity of names,
and an examination of the typography of the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
printers shows that they must have been different
people.</p>

<p>Of John Butler, the next printer to be noticed, next
to nothing is known. Ames asserted on the authority
of Maurice Johnson, a gentleman to whom he was
indebted for many startling pieces of information, that
he was a judge of the Common Pleas. There was a
John Boteler a judge, but when he was sitting on the
bench our John Butler was engaged as a journeyman
with Wynkyn de Worde, who in 1535 left by will to
“John Butler late my servant as many printed books as
shall amounte to the value of vi£ sterling,” a very
considerable legacy for the time.</p>

<p>His only dated book, an edition of the <i>Parvulorum
institutio ex Stanbrigiana collectione</i> was issued in 1529.
The colophon states that it was printed “for John
Butler,” but it absolutely agrees typographically with
other grammatical tracts printed “by John Butler”
though the type of all is apparently identical with that
used by John Skot. Besides the one dated book there
are eight undated. Five are grammatical tracts of
little interest, and the remaining three are <i>The Jeaste of
Sir Gawayne</i>, <i>The Doctrynale of good servantes</i>, and
<i>The Convercyon of Swerers</i>. It is interesting to
notice that of all the books printed by Butler but one
copy is known.</p>

<p>The <i>Expositiones terminorum legum Anglorum</i> of
1527, attributed by Herbert and others to this printer,
is clearly the work of Rastell.</p>

<p>Butler carried on business at the sign of St John
Evangelist in Fleet Street and used as a device a small
woodcut of St John with the inscription cut upon it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
“Initium sancti euangelii secundum Johannem.” This
cut was not originally intended for a printer’s mark, but
was one of a series engraved for a <i>Horae</i>. Whether or
not he was really a practical printer it is impossible to
determine, for the words “printed by” are not always to
be taken as literally true. Several books of this period
are known, identical except as regards the wording of
the colophon, which profess to have been printed by
different printers; and many books which bear the
name of one printer in the colophon can be clearly
proved to be the work of another.</p>

<p>John Toy has to be included as a printer in this
lecture on the faith of the colophon of one book, but
probably, like some early stationers, he was not always
strictly truthful and said “printed by” when he meant
“printed for.” However, in the Bodleian Library there
is an edition of the <i>Gradus comparationum</i> whose
colophon runs, “Imprinted at London in Poules
chyrche yard, at the sygne of saynte Nycolas by me
John Toye. The yere of our lorde God <span class="allsmcap">M.D.XXXI</span>, the
<span class="allsmcap">XXX</span> day of May.” But the book ends with the device
of the printer John Skot, and it is probable that he
really printed it. In 1534 Toy had an edition of the
<i>Shorter Accidence</i> of Stanbridge printed for him at
Antwerp by Martin de Keyser, and of this there is a
copy in the Cambridge University Library. In 1534
Leonard Cox wrote a letter to “The Goodman Toy at
the sign of St Nicholas in Pauls Churchyard” relating
to the printing of some translations of portions of the
Paraphrase of Erasmus, perhaps the Epistle to Titus
which appeared some time later. Toy, like many in his
business appears to have married the widow of another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
stationer Nicholas Sutton. Toy died in 1535 and his
will is preserved in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury.</p>

<p>Richard Bankes, who began to print in 1523, was
the first of a series of printers who lived at “The long
shop in the Poultry beside St Mildred’s church door at
the stocks,” and the first book he issued was a collection
of stories which he called “goodly and right pleasant,”
though they hardly merit that description, entitled
<i>The IX Drunkardes</i>.</p>

<p>This very curious little book, of which the only copy
known is in the Bodleian, sets forth the evils of drink as
exemplified by various Scriptural characters. It is a
translation from the Dutch and is illustrated with a
number of foreign woodcuts and borders.</p>

<p>From 1523 to 1526 Bankes printed five dated books
and then ceased to work for thirteen years, though he
had one book printed for him by Robert Copland in
1528. When he next appears as a printer in 1539 he
was living next the White Hart in Fleet Street and
was apparently subsidised to print the works of Richard
Taverner, an ardent reformer, a religious writer, and
<span class="allsmcap">M.P.</span> for Liverpool.</p>

<p>In 1540 immediately after Cromwell’s death a
series of ballads attacking and defending him were
written by Thomas Smyth, clerk of the Queen’s Council,
and William Gray, a servant of Cromwell’s. These came
before the notice of the Privy Council and the two
authors together with Richard Bankes the printer were
summoned to appear at eight o’clock in the morning on
Sunday, 3rd January 1541. The notice of this trial
brings up a new point of great interest to bibliographers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
Copies of these ballads are still extant in the library of
the Society of Antiquaries, several with Bankes’s full
imprint, and in the indictment he is spoken of as “noted
to be the printer.” When the case came on however
Bankes absolutely denied that he had printed them and
laid the blame on Robert Redman lately deceased, and
Richard Grafton, who confessed he had printed some of
them. On January 4 Smyth, Gray and Grafton were
committed to the Fleet. This account shows that the
colophons of the early printers, especially in the case of
small fugitive pieces, are not to be implicitly trusted,
and emphasizes the necessity of a careful study of type.
Such a study also often shows that some of the smaller
printers were probably not printers at all, but had their
books printed for them.</p>

<p>Bankes last appears in 1545, when he issued with
Richard Lant the Booke of Cookery, of which there is a
copy in the Hunterian Museum at Glasgow.</p>

<p>Lawrence Andrewe, who printed in Fleet Street
near Fleet Bridge at the sign of the Golden Cross, was
a native of Calais and seems to have had some connexion
with John of Doesborch, the Antwerp printer, for
whom he translated several Dutch books into English,
among them the <i>Valuation of gold and silver</i>, and a
book called <i>The wonderful shape and nature that our
Saviour Christ Jesu hath created in beasts, serpents,
fowls</i>, etc. He only issued two books with a date, two
editions of Jerome of Brunswick’s <i>Boke of Distillacyon</i>;
and not only were they printed in the same year, but
they were finished on two consecutive days, the 17th
and 18th of April. These two editions vary throughout,
and the reason for the double issue seems inexplicable.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
His undated books comprise editions of Aesop’s <i>Fables</i>,
and the <i>Mirror of the World</i>, in folio, the latter being
ornamented with a profusion of miscellaneous woodcuts
obtained from various sources; and the <i>Directory of the
conscience</i> and the <i>Debate and stryfe betwene Somer and
Wynter</i> in quarto. The <i>Debate</i> was to be sold “at the
signe of seynt John Evangelyst in saynt Martyns
parysshe besyde Charynge crosse” presumably by
Robert Wyer and may therefore be dated about 1530.
In 1529 Andrewe was apparently associated with Peter
Treveris in the production of the <i>Grete Herball</i>, for
some copies contain his device. This device consisted
of his mark on a large shield within a frame of pillars
and festoons of very florid work. In some of the
initials in his books his mark will be found, showing
that they were specially engraved for him. About 1534
a certain printer named Leonard Andrewe, who may
have been a relation, was an assistant to John Rastell.</p>

<p>Though about all these early printers we have but
meagre information, the career of Thomas Godfray is
particularly obscure. His name is found in over thirty
books; only two contain an address, in each different,
and only one a date. The dated book is the <i>Chaucer</i> of
1532 printed at London by Thomas Godfray, itself a
curious puzzle. It was edited by William Thynne and
had a preface by Sir Brian Tuke, and a copy discovered
by Henry Bradshaw in the library of Clare College,
Cambridge, has the inscription “This preface I sir
Bryan Tuke knight wrot at the request of Mr Clarke of
the Kechyn then being, tarying for the tyde at
Grenewich.” Now Leland, the antiquary, distinctly
states that this edition was issued by Thomas Berthelet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
and as he was a contemporary of Godfray and Berthelet
his words cannot be lightly passed over. The title-page
border used by Godfray in the <i>Chaucer</i> and the <i>Gift of
Constantine</i> [1534] was used by Berthelet as early as
1535; and he used in the same year another border
frame which Godfray employed in the <i>Introductorie for
to lerne French</i> by Giles Dewes and which was cracked
during the printing of that book. Though we have no
direct evidence of the fact it would seem as though
Godfray’s press was subsidized by Berthelet, to a great
extent, perhaps, owing to the latter’s occupation with
official work. Another point to be noticed is that
Godfray never mentions any sign, and this is nearly
always found to be the case with printers who worked
for others and not for themselves. Two of Godfray’s
books can be dated from outside evidence. <i>The Gift of
Constantine</i> was issued early in 1534, for on April 1
Marshall, at whose expense it was published, wrote to
Cromwell, “I send you two books now finished of the
Gift of Constantine. I think there was none ever
better set forth for defacing of the pope of Rome.” He
also writes, “On the book of Constantine I have laid out
all the money I can make, and for lack of it cannot
fetch the books from the printers.” The second book
is Christopher Saint-Germain’s <i>Answer to a Letter</i>
which cannot be earlier than 1535, a date found in the
book itself. Godfray worked at one time in the Old
Bailey and at another, probably later, at Temple Bar,
where he would be close to Berthelet. He made no
use of any device.</p>

</div>

<p class="c sp">RICHARD PYNSON AND THE LEARNED PRINTERS.</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">Having</span> treated in my last lecture of Wynkyn de
Worde and his followers who represent the popular
printers of the time, I come to-day to Richard Pynson
and his school, who represent the more learned press.
We have Haukins and Redman, Pynson’s successors;
William Faques who preceded and Thomas Berthelet
who succeeded him as printer to the King; and the
two Rastells, John and William, brother-in-law and
nephew to Sir Thomas More, distinguished in the law.</p>

<p>Pynson, who had learned to print in Normandy,
came to England some time before 1492 and started as
a printer outside Temple Bar, near the church of St
Clement Danes, where he continued up to 1500. In
1500, while still living there he along with his servants
were the victims of a murderous attack from a riotous
gathering headed by one Henry Squire. In his
evidence before the Star-Chamber Pynson stated that
his servants were so terrified by frequent threats and
attacks that they had left him, and his business was
suffering in consequence. This is quite likely to have
been the cause of his moving, since he would be much
safer and better protected within the City. The move<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
was not a distant one for it was to a house which had
belonged to the College of St Stephen in Westminster
with the sign of the George next to St Dunstan’s
Church in Fleet Street, at the corner where Chancery
Lane runs into it. He was still but a few doors from
Temple Bar, but this time on the right side of it. The
year 1500 was also an important one to Pynson, for in
that year Cardinal Morton died, who had been a
valuable patron, and at whose cost the beautiful Sarum
<i>Missal</i> of 1500 had been produced.</p>

<p>The first book issued by Pynson at his new address
was an edition of the Sarum <i>Directorium Sacerdotum</i>,
of which there is a perfect copy at Ripon, and an imperfect
one in the British Museum, which belonged to
Cranmer. The colophon sets forth that it was printed
“intra barram novi templi” in 1501, so that the date of
Pynson’s move to St Dunstan’s parish is clearly defined
as between the publication of the <i>Book of Cookery</i> in
1500 and this <i>Directorium</i> in 1501.</p>

<p>The only other book issued this year was a small
tract describing the escort and reception to be accorded
to Katherine of Aragon.</p>

<p>Before speaking further of Pynson I should like to
refer to a point which I emphasized when speaking of
De Worde and Notary, that is, the method he followed
in dating his books. In my former lectures I asserted
that he probably began his year on January 1, and for this
reason. The beautiful <i>Missal</i> printed at the expense of
Cardinal Morton was finished on January 10, 1500, and
the Cardinal died in September of that year. If Pynson
meant by his January 10, 1500, what we should call
1501, then the book would have been issued after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
Cardinal’s death, and though the colophon tells us that
the book was printed at his command and expense, it
has no mention of his being dead.</p>

<p>The book called the <i>Rule of St Benet</i> has sometimes
been pointed out as a proof of Pynson beginning his
year on March 25. The words in the preface run, “We
have ... caused it to be emprinted by our wel beloved
Rycharde Pynson of London printer. The <span class="allsmcap">XXII.</span> day of
the monethe of January, the yere of oure Lorde
<span class="allsmcap">M.CCCCC.XVI.</span> and the <span class="allsmcap">VIII.</span> yere of the reigne of oure
soverayne lorde kynge Henry the <span class="allsmcap">VIII.</span>” In this case
January 22, 1516, is clearly what we should call 1517,
but then the words are not those of the printer but of
the author, and it is noteworthy that the printer in his
colophon gives no date at all. Doubtless a detailed
examination of all books printed between January 1,
and March 25, would settle the question, but such an
examination is at the present time very difficult. To
perform such work exactly a very large number of
minute tests have to be formulated and applied, and
library after library visited, frequently three or four
times as new developments are discovered. When the
day comes that our best libraries have adequate photographic
facilities these questions will be nearer solution.
In 1502 Pynson printed nine books, mostly of a liturgical
or scholastic nature, the only one deserving of particular
notice being the Sarum <i>Processional</i> issued in November.
Of this book one copy is known printed upon
vellum, which is now in the library of St John’s College,
Oxford.</p>

<p>In 1503 Pynson printed three books, the first
English translation of the <i>Imitatio Christi</i>, a new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
edition of the <i>Directorium Sacerdotum</i>, and an edition
of the <i>Mirror of the Life of Christ</i>. This last book I
can only give on the authority of the catalogue of
Edwards the bookseller, in 1794, for I do not know
where any perfect copy is preserved. A slightly imperfect
copy however presumably of this edition was
sent to me to examine a few years ago. In 1504 the
only dated book is a very fine Sarum <i>Missal</i>, of which
there is a copy in Emmanuel College and a copy on
vellum, slightly imperfect, in Manchester. A curious
work on natural philosophy by Hieronymus de Sancto
Marcho issued in 1505 has Pynson’s device on the title,
though it seems probable that he was not the printer.
The printer, whoever he was, had not a full supply of
numerals, and in place of the two 5’s in the date he has
printed two small black-letter h’s as the nearest
approach in type to the numeral. The remaining books
of this year are of small interest.</p>

<p>In 1506 Pynson issued an edition of the <i>Principia</i>
of Peregrinus de Lugo for the Oxford bookseller George
Castellain. The imprint runs “per Ricardum Pinson
cum Solerti cura ac diligentia honestissimi juvenis ac
prudentissimi Hugonis Meslier.” Nothing whatever is
known of this assistant of Pynson’s, whose name occurs
only in this book. In this same year was issued an
edition of the <i>Kalendar of Shephardes</i>, which has a
curious preface referring to the earlier edition of 1503,
which was translated from the French into the Scottish
language and printed at Paris by Antoine Verard; and
also a Sarum <i>Manual</i> of which there are two copies on
vellum, one in the library of Corpus Christi College,
Cambridge, the other at Stonyhurst. In 1507 two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
noteworthy books were issued, an edition of the <i>Golden
Legend</i>, of which the unique (and happily quite perfect)
copy is at Lambeth, and a Sarum <i>Breviary</i>, of which two
copies are known, both printed on vellum and not quite
perfect. The copy in the Rylands Library, the one
described by successive bibliographers, was in the
collections of Ratcliffe and Count MacCarthy but the
date had been cut out of the colophon and the book
was usually ascribed to 1508. However, four years ago
another copy appeared for sale in an auction and was
bought by a private collector. In it the colophon was
quite perfect and gave the exact date, August 25,
1507.</p>

<p>Some time after May, 1508, on the death of William
Faques, Pynson succeeded to the office of Printer to
the King; so that he was not as usually stated
appointed by Henry VIII. At first an annuity of two
pounds was paid him and in 1515 the sum was raised to
four pounds. The office of King’s Printer though in
many ways lucrative was not without its drawbacks.
Though he obtained all Government work he was
compelled to lay aside his other work until it was
finished, which must sometimes have been inconvenient.</p>

<p>The stirring events of 1509 seem to have had no
effect on Pynson’s work, and while W. de Worde issued
some thirty dated books he contented himself with five,
and only one was of any importance from a literary
point of view. This was Alexander Barclay’s translation
of Brant’s <i>Ship of Fools</i>. This fine folio is printed in
black-letter and roman type and contains a number of
excellent woodcuts. It also contains the full-page cut
of Pynson’s arms here used for the first time, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
probably only lately granted to him on his appointment
as King’s Printer, which carried with it the title of
Esquire. A small work of Savonarola issued on the
eighth of September this year is interesting as being
the first dated work issued in England printed entirely
in Roman letter, though it is not improbable that the
undated oration of Peter Gryphus also issued this year
may be a month or two earlier.</p>

<p>It is quite evident on examining the various
accounts paid to Pynson by the King that a great deal
of his official work has absolutely disappeared. In the
many cases where definite proclamations, statutes, or
similar productions are quoted, hardly any evidence of
their existence is now to be found. Of course having
once served their purpose they would become obsolete
and mere waste, but as many were printed on vellum—in
one case we find 400 skins printed, in another 450—it
seems impossible that all could have been entirely
destroyed. Numbers no doubt found their way into the
hands of the bookbinders and were used to line bindings,
for which purpose, having one side blank, they
were very suitable; and it is from old bindings that the
greater number of those extant have been recovered.</p>

<p>In 1511 he issued the <i>Pylgrymage of Sir Richard
Guylforde</i>, a most interesting book to read, as it gives a
vivid description of a journey to the Holy Land and
of the death and burial of Sir Richard while there.</p>

<p>Among the books of 1513 was an edition of Lidgate’s
<i>Sege and Destruccyon of Troye</i>, of which he printed
several copies on vellum, one of which is in Pepys’s
collection, as he did also of the <i>Statutes of War</i>, which
appeared in the same year, though no copies are now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
known. Another lost book of this year would have had
peculiar interest. Ammonius wrote to Erasmus, shortly
after Flodden, “Petrus Carmelianus has just published an
epitaph on the King of Scots, stuffed full of womanly
abuse, which you may soon read printed in Pynson’s
type.” For the next few years there is little of interest
to chronicle in his work.</p>

<p>In 1521 was issued Henry VIII’s book the <i>Assertio
septem sacramentorum</i>. As might be expected many
copies were printed on vellum and sent round as
presents to the princes of Europe, generally containing
an inscription in the King’s hand. Four copies at least
are now in existence, two being in the Vatican. About
this book there is a curious story. Montaigne in the
journal of his voyage to Italy in 1581 said, “I saw the
original of the book that the King of England composed
against Luther which he sent about fifty years since to
Pope Leo X subscribed of his proper hand with this
beautiful Latin distich, also of his hand,</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Hoc opus, et fidei testem et amicitiae.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Unfortunately there is still extant among the State
papers a letter from Cardinal Wolsey to Henry in
which the Cardinal writes, “I do send also unto your
highnes the choyse of certyne versis to be written in
the booke to be sent to the pope of your owne hande.”
So much for the royal author.</p>

<p>Between 1522 and 1525 the first edition of Froissart
was issued in two folio volumes, and it is one of those
books that puzzle the bibliographer as there are many
variations and cancels in the different copies. In 1522<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
appeared Tunstall’s <i>De arte supputandi</i>, generally
described as the first English printed book on arithmetic.
A presentation copy on vellum is in the
University Library and another imperfect vellum copy
in Christ’s College. In 1526 appeared an edition of
Chaucer to which I think proper attention has not
been paid. It is generally described as consisting only
of the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, but this is not the case. The
book was issued in various parts of which the <i>Canterbury
Tales</i> is one, and other works were issued in other
parts though no library contains a complete set. How
many parts really existed I do not know, but it looks as
if the intention had been to issue the complete works.
In 1526 and 1527 editions of Henry’s VIII letters
against Martin Luther were issued, but unlike the
<i>Assertio</i> no copies seem to have been printed on vellum.</p>

<p>Beyond the issue of three small law-books in 1528
Pynson seems to have issued nothing up to his death
in 1530, and there is no obvious reason to account for
this. There is something rather mysterious about the
relations between Pynson and Robert Redman, who will
be noticed later, for all the books printed by the latter
between 1528 and the death of Pynson, when he
succeeded to his shop, bear no address, and it is just
possible that some arrangement had been made between
them. The bindings produced by Pynson are of very
rare occurrence. He used two panels of a small size.
One contains his mark within a broad border and is
very similar in design to his device. The other
contains the Tudor rose in the centre with a border of
foliage and flowers and vine-leaves in the corners.
There is an example in the British Museum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>Pynson died at the beginning of the year 1530 and
his will dated November 1529 was proved on the 18th of
February following. He left property in Chancery Lane
and Tottenham but there is little of interest in the will
itself. He left bequests to his two apprentices John
Snowe and Richard Withers on condition of their
faithfully serving out their apprenticeships. At the
time of his death he had only one child alive, his
daughter Margaret, who had married first a certain
William Campion, probably a stationer, by whom she
had two daughters, Amye and Joane, and secondly a
man named Warde. Pynson’s son Richard is described
as lately deceased, but he had left a daughter Joan
who was old enough to be married in 1537. It is
almost certainly this son Richard, and not as usually
asserted his father, who took out letters of denization
in 1513, for Richard Pynson the elder could never have
risen to be King’s Printer and to have the right to bear
arms without having been made a denizen. Everything
points to the fact that he was not only denizened
but naturalised, but the son who from his age must
have been born abroad would require letters of denization
also.</p>

<p>After Pynson’s death at the beginning of 1530 a
certain John Haukins completed and issued the curious
book on which Pynson had been at work for some time,
<i>L’Eclarcissement de la langue Française</i> by John
Palsgrave. The history of this book is somewhat
mysterious. At the end of 1523 an indenture was
made out between John Palsgrave and Pynson for the
printing of 60 reams of paper at six and eightpence a
ream. Another indenture of the same year was for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
printing 750 copies of <i>Lesclarcissement de la lange
Francoys</i>, containing three sundry books. Pynson
engaged to print daily a sheet on both sides [that is
four pages] and Palsgrave agreed not to keep him
waiting for copy.</p>

<p>The final indenture dated January 18, 15 Hen. VIII
[1524], between John Palsgrave, prebendary of St Paul’s,
and Richard Pynson citizen and stationer of London,
arranges for the printing of a book named <i>Lez le
Clarissimaunt de la lange Francois</i>, containing three
books, with certain tables and a French vocabulist.
Palsgrave will pay six and eightpence for each ream of
paper 20 quires; 750 copies are to be printed, of which
Pynson shall have as many as, at a price agreed between
them, will pay him at the above rate. Clauses to be
inserted that Pynson shall not print more than 750 till
that number is sold, and that Palsgrave shall deliver
the copy from time to time truly corrected. The book
as we now have it consists of three parts. The first
has the title, introduction, and index, and a privilege
from the King dated September 2, 1530, so that the
printing must be after that date. The second contains
two books, one on pronunciation, the other on the nine
parts of speech and ends with Pynson’s device. The third
part contains the third book with tables of words and
ending with this colophon, “Thus endeth this booke
called <i>Lesclarissement de la langue Francoyse</i>, whiche is
very necessarye for all suche as intende to lerne to
speke trewe frenche; the imprintyng fynyssed by
Johan Haukyns the <span class="allsmcap">XVIII</span> daye of July. The yere of
our lorde god, <span class="allsmcap">M.CCCCC.</span> and <span class="allsmcap">XXX.</span>” In the preface of
the author to the King he speaks of his having formerly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
written two “sundrie” books on the subject which he had
“offred” to the Princess Mary, the King’s sister, and
Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, her husband. These
two books I take to be the two contained in the second
part of <i>Lesclarcissement</i> which were certainly printed
by Pynson. A curious piece of information about the
book occurs in a letter dated April 13, 1529, written
by Stephen Vaughan to Cromwell. In it he says that
“he wishes to learn French and when in London asked
Mr Palsgrave for one of his books, which he refused.
Requests Cromwell to get one for him, as Palsgrave will
not refuse him. Hears he has told Pynson to sell them
only to those he names lest his profit as a teacher should
be diminished. Would esteem one no less than a jewel and
will send Cromwell something of greater value in return.”</p>

<p>Now in Pynson’s first agreement he was to print
60 reams of paper, that is 1200 quires and 750 copies
of the book. This gives to each copy of the book
1-3/5 quires of paper, and taking twenty sheets to the
quire, each book would contain 64 leaves. The middle
part of <i>Lesclarcissement</i> consists of 60 leaves without any
title-page or prefatory matter. My theory is that this
portion with a title and preface was issued in or soon
after 1524. We see that Palsgrave was very chary of
selling copies, so that many would remain in the
printer’s hands. At a much later date the large third
part containing the vocabularies was put in hand and
finished in July, 1530, by John Haukins. The copies of
the middle part were added to it, their old title and
prefatory matter cancelled and a new title, index,
and prefatory matter printed for the whole book some
time after September 1530.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>As the wording of the agreements mentioned above
is slightly ambiguous, a word of explanation is necessary.
The 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> which Palsgrave paid per ream was the
price of the paper itself and not the printing of it.
Palsgrave was to pay for the paper and Pynson was to
have so many copies to sell at a rate agreed upon as
would repay him his outlay in printing. The average
cost at that time for printing in comparison to paper
was as four to one. The ream costing 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, the
printing and printer’s profit of the ream would amount
to £1. 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, thus the total cost of a ream, paper,
printing, and all would be £1. 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> I have collected
many notices of the price of printing-paper from the
time of Arnold’s <i>Chronicle</i> (about 1496) during the
whole of our period, and while writing-paper went so
high as thirty-four shillings and fourpence a ream,
printing-paper was invariably 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i></p>

<p>William Faques, who succeeded Peter Actors, the
first stationer to the King, as the first King’s Printer, is
but a very shadowy figure, and of his life we know nothing.
He was a native of Normandy, and Herbert suggests,
but without any reason, that he may have learned his
art with Jean le Bourgeois. The only date connected
with his books is 1504, in which year he printed a
proclamation on the coinage, the <i>Statutes of the Nineteenth
Year of Henry VII</i>, and a Latin <i>Psalter</i>. This
last book shows that unknown or not Faques was a
skilful printer, for it is one of the most beautiful books
issued from the early English press. The type is sharp
and brilliant, the printing in red well done, and each
page is surrounded with a chain-like border. On the
first leaf is the printer’s device, a very uncommon one,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
consisting of two triangles. On one is the verse
(Psalm xxxvii. 16) in black letters on a white ground,
“Melius est modicum iusto super divitias peccatorum
multas.” On the second triangle in white letters on a
black ground the text (Prov. xvi. 32), “Melior est patiens
viro forti et qui dominat.” Thus stopping suddenly, not
only in the middle of a verse, but the middle of a word.</p>

<p>In the centre is his monogram transfixed by an
arrow. The presence of this arrow is very puzzling, for
it also plays an important part in the device of Richard
Faques, William’s successor. The early printers were
very fond, where possible, of introducing punning allusions
into their devices, and this arrow may have some
connexion with the name Faques.</p>

<p>Of the <i>Psalter</i> some six copies are known, and one
printed upon vellum is in the library of Emmanuel
College.</p>

<p>The <i>Statutes</i>, of which only the British Museum
copy is known, has a fairly full colophon, “Here endeth
the statutes holden at Westmestyr the xxv day of
Janiuere in ye xix yere of ye moste nobyll reigne of
kynge Henry the VII. Enprynted in London within
Seynt Helens be Guillam Faques ye kyng Prynter.”
St Helens was in Bishopsgate Ward. Two other books
with Faques’ name are known, an edition of the
<i>Vulgaria Terentii</i>, and the homily of Origen, <i>De beata
Maria Magdalena</i>. Both these little books are without
date and both are stated to have been printed in
Abchurch Lane. Two copies are known of the Origen,
of the <i>Vulgaria</i> the only known copy is in the library
of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. These books
are curious in having the top part of the title cut in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
wood, a peculiarity which Pynson copied immediately
afterwards, perhaps employing the same woodcutter.</p>

<p>William Faques no doubt died in 1508 for R. Pynson
was appointed King’s Printer in that year. He was
succeeded in business by Richard Faques, who was
presumably a near relation and a foreigner, and we may
discard as a fable the statement made to Ames by
“Mr Thomas Wilson of Leeds, in Yorkshire,” who in a
letter 2 April, 1751, informed him that Richard Fawkes,
printer, was second son of John Fawkes, of Farnley Hall,
in the said county, Esq.; and in a pedigree he had of
that family he was called printer, of London.</p>

<p>In 1509 Richard Faques issued the <i>Salus corporis
salus anime</i> of Gulielmus de Saliceto, a book printed
with his predecessor’s type and with the chain ornament,
and in 1511 issued with W. de Worde an edition of the
Sarum <i>Missal</i>. His device, very well cut, is a copy of
that used by Thielman Kerver, but with some alterations.
Two unicorns standing amid flowers and foliage
support a shield hung from a large arrow on which are
the initials R.F. and a maiden’s head, in reference to
the sign of the shop where he carried on business, the
Maiden’s Head in St Paul’s Churchyard. Below on a
ribbon his name is cut, Richard Faques. In 1521 when
we next find a dated book he had removed to another
shop in the churchyard with the sign of the A. B. C.
He had also made a change in his device, anglicising
his name by cutting out the “ques” of Faques and
inserting “kes” in its place in type. It is interesting to
notice that in all the five dated books which he issued he
made a change in the spelling of his name, each time
making it more English. In 1509 it was Fax, in 1511<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
Faques, in 1521 Fakes, in 1523 Faukes, and in 1530
Fawkes. In 1523 besides his shop in St Paul’s Churchyard
he had a dwelling-house, where probably he printed,
in Durham Rents, in the Strand. In the assessment of
Aliens for the subsidy of 1524 as printed by the
Huguenot Society a Richard Far is given in the Strand,
and I think it is quite likely that Far is a misreading
for Fax. A good deal of the Strand was in Westminster,
and in the Westminster denization roll of 1544 is one
Amelyne Faxe, widow, aged 70 years, in England 55
years. “Hath the Kinge’s Magestie’s proteccion of his
grace gyft to Richard Faxe her husbond, late deceased,
to remayn and dwell within this realm, but her landlorde
will not suffre her to dwell in house.”</p>

<p>The Richard Fawkes here mentioned, if he was the
same as the printer, died in 1538 and was buried in
the parish of St Martin in the Fields.</p>

<p>The last book issued by R. Faques was the <i>Mirrour
of Our Lady</i> of 1530 printed at the desire and instance
of the abbess and general confessor of the Monastery
of Syon. It is a beautiful volume with several woodcuts,
one of them signed E. G. similar to one in a
Pynson book, and a number of curious initial letters.
A certain Michael Fawkes was joined with Robert
Copland in 1534-5 in printing an edition of the <i>Tree
and</i> <span class="allsmcap">XII</span> <i>frutes of the holy goost</i>, and also printed the
<i>Consolation of timorouse and fearfull consciencys</i> of
which there is a copy in the British Museum, but
beyond this nothing is known of him.</p>

<p>Robert Redman began to print in the year 1523,
his first book, of which there is a copy in the Cambridge
University Library, being an edition of Fitzherbert’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
<i>Diversite de courtz</i>. His next dated book, an edition of
the <i>Magna Charta</i>, was issued in 1525, and in this
his address is given at the sign of the George in
St Clement’s parish, elsewhere described as just outside
Temple Bar. Considering the custom of printers
in successively occupying the same houses, it is probable
that this is the same printing-office as that used first
by Pynson and then by Julian Notary. Now at this
time Pynson was at work close by on the other side of
Temple Bar and his sign was also the George, and
when Redman not only used his sign but began to
issue editions of the books he had been accustomed to
print, we can understand the older printer becoming
very indignant. The publication of an edition of
Littleton’s <i>Tenures</i> by Redman apparently brought
matters to a crisis, and Pynson in his edition of the
same book issued in 1525 gave expression to his
feelings in a somewhat strongly worded “letter to the
reader.” In it he points out how much more correct
and well printed his work is as compared with that of
Robert Redman, or more properly Rudeman, for among
a thousand it would be hard to find one more unskilled.
He wonders how he can call himself a printer, unless
the devil made him one when he made the cobbler
into a skipper. Formerly the scoundrel professed
himself as skilled a bookseller as ever came from
Utopia, well knowing a thing can be called a book
when it has merely the appearance of one and little
else. He finishes up by abusing him for daring to
promise that he could print the laws of England
properly, and asks the reader to judge for himself.
To this invective Redman returned no answer but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
continued to issue his books as before, and though
Pynson on one or two other occasions repeated his
attacks they produced no effect, unless perhaps the
addition to his colophons which Redman sometimes
printed, “Si deus nobiscum quis contra nos.”</p>

<p>It was suggested by Herbert and others that
Redman removed into Fleet Street before April 18,
1527. There certainly is an edition of the <i>Modus
tenendi unum hundredum</i> of that date with a distinct
colophon stating that the book was printed by Redman
at the George in St Dunstan’s parish that is within
Temple Bar, outside being St Clement’s parish. But
this date must be a misprint, not only because colophons
of 1528 again give him as living in St Clement’s
parish, but also he could hardly have occupied Pynson’s
house while the latter was still at work. It is a curious
point to notice that during the period between 1528
and 1530 Redman gives no address in his books.
Immediately on Pynson’s death, however, at the beginning
of 1530 Redman not only moved into his house,
but took over part of his material, and for the future
made use of one or other of his old rival’s devices.
Previous to this he had no distinctive device, but made
use of some small cuts, one of the Infant Christ seated,
another of St George, and a third of the Trinity. He
used in all, three of Pynson’s devices, the original black
block with the white monogram with which Pynson
had first started, a rarer small metal device, not often
used, which has a pierced ribbon at the bottom in
which the printer’s name could be inserted in type,
and the large late wood-block. On March 23, 1530, he
issued the first book from his new address, an edition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
of the <i>Natura Brevium</i>. The book is dated March 23,
1529, but this must of course mean 1530, and shows
that at any rate as regards law-books Redman began
his year on March 25. To law-books Redman mainly
confined his attention, and the books in other classes
which he issued are not as a rule of much interest.
He appears not to have had much initiative, but
contented himself with reprinting popular books. In
1533 this practice led him into trouble, for in February
of that year he was bound over in the sum of 500 marks
not to sell the book called ‘<i>The division of the Spiritualty
and the Temporalty</i>’ nor any other book privileged
by the King. The printing of this book had been
granted to Berthelet, who as King’s Printer would be in
a position to enforce his rights. It was of this book
that More wrote in his <i>Apology</i>, “And in this poynt
they lay for a sample the goodlye and godlye, milde
and gentle fashion used by him, whosoever he was, that
now lately wrote the booke of the division betwene the
temporaltie and the spiritualtie, which charitable mild
manner they say that if I had used, my woorkes
would have been read both of many moe, and with
much better will.” The authorship though unknown
to More is generally ascribed to Christopher St
Germain.</p>

<p>Among the more interesting books printed by
Redman may be mentioned editions of the <i>Life of
Christ</i>, <i>The Frute of Redempcion</i>, <i>The Pomander of
Prayer</i>, Fewterer’s <i>Myrrour of Christes Passion</i> written
in 1533 and printed the year after, and Whitford’s
<i>Dayly Exercise</i> in which he complains, like Caxton,
that having been asked to write out his book over and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
over again he had thought better to print it and thus
save himself so much labour.</p>

<p>A very curious border piece was sometimes used by
Redman, as for instance in the English translation of
Lyndewode’s <i>Constitutions</i> of 1534 and the <i>Book of
Justices of Peas</i>, which contains in the lower margin
the initials I. N. and I. M. Who these initials refer to
I have not been able to discover, but the design of the
border was popular and was used by Pynson and at
Antwerp by Michael Hillenius, while it is also found
in some of Tindale’s books. It may have been
engraved for some stationer and afterwards obtained
by Redman. The last important work on which
Redman was engaged was a folio edition of the <i>Bible</i>,
which he printed in partnership with Thomas Petyt
for Berthelet.</p>

<p>Redman died in 1540 between October 21, the date
of his will, and November 4, when it was proved. He
left his property to be divided into three parts. The
first for bequests and funeral expenses, the second to
his wife, and the third to his children. One of his
executors was his son-in-law Henry Smith, a stationer
and printer of law-books who lived at the sign of the
Trinity, without Temple Bar, in St Clement’s parish,
perhaps the very house which had once been in the
occupation of Redman, who had used a device of the
Trinity as one of his early marks. Redman’s wife
Elizabeth, whose maiden name had been Pickering,
continued to carry on the business by herself for a
short while, but retired on her remarriage with Ralph
Cholmondeley, when the printing-office and its effects
passed to William Middleton.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>A certain John Redman, born in 1508 and who was
in business as a stationer at least as early as 1530, may
have been a relation, though there is no direct proof.
He printed at Southwark a small work of Cicero for
Robert Redman which lends some probability to the
theory, and on Robert’s death in 1540 he appears to
have moved to London to a shop in Paternoster Row
with the sign of Our Lady of Pity.</p>

<p>Thomas Berthelet, Pynson’s successor as King’s
Printer, seems to have been at one time in his employment
as apprentice or assistant, and may most probably
be identical with the Thomas Bercula or Berclaeus who
speaks of himself as the printer in several books issued
by Pynson. The earliest in which this name appears is
an edition of the <i>Vulgaria</i> of Whitinton issued in 1520,
and after the editor’s preface is a short address to the
reader by Thomas Bercula Typographus. There is no
definite statement to connect Bercula and Berthelet
and yet it is hard to see who else the name could apply
to. Berthelet may have come into the business to take
the place of Pynson’s son Richard who had died, but it
is curious that there is no reference to him in Pynson’s
will. In 1524 Berthelet married his first wife, for it
seems most probable that he is the person referred to
in the following entry in the register of marriage
licences granted by the Bishop of London, “1524
August 23 Thomas Barthelett of St Dunstan in the
West and Agnes Langwyth, widow, at St Bride’s, Fleet
Street.” In 1528 he started business on his own
account, his first book being Thomas Paynell’s translation
of the <i>Regimen sanitatis Salerni</i>: ‘This boke techying
al people to governe them in helthe.’ The colophon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
runs “Imprinted in London in Flete Strete in the
House of Thomas Berthelet nere to ye cundite at ye
signe of Lucrece. Anno domini 1528, mense Augusto.”
Another work of Paynell’s, entitled <i>The Assault and
Conquest of Heaven</i>, was issued in 1529. Berthelet’s
shop must have been further east than Pynson’s
and close by Wynkyn de Worde’s, though it is impossible
to say on which side of Fleet Street it stood.
Two other early books often quoted as earlier than 1530
may be noted here. One is a work by Wakefield on
the divorce controversy, quoted by Wood in the <i>Athenae
Oxonienses</i> and dated by him 1528, the other is an
edition of the <i>Statutes</i>, the first book of Berthelet’s
given by Herbert and said to be dated 1529. The first
of these, of which there is a copy in the Bodleian, is
without date, but from the subject-matter cannot be
before 1533 and from the fact that the printer is styled
King’s Printer could not be earlier than 1530. For
this latter reason also the <i>Statutes</i> of 1529 must be
non-existent. One or two books, such as Erasmus on
the Lord’s Prayer, in which he does not style himself
King’s Printer, may perhaps be assigned to before
1530.</p>

<p>On February 15, 1530, immediately after Pynson’s
death, Berthelet was appointed Printer to the King with
an annuity of four pounds. Just a few days before he had
issued an edition of Paynell’s translation of the <i>Regimen
sanitatis Salerni</i> which is very interesting as illustrating
a point I have several times referred to. The book is
dated February, 1530, and Berthelet is not spoken of as
King’s Printer, a fact he emphasized very particularly
as soon as he had risen to that position. We may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
conclude therefore that in this colophon February 1530
does not mean February 1531 and that therefore
Berthelet calculated his year as beginning on January 1.</p>

<p>After the Royal appointment Berthelet’s press
started on an active career, and the first book issued,
naturally one on the political question then engaging
the attention of Europe, was an important work on the
subject of the royal divorce. This was the first edition,
in Latin, of the <i>Determinations of the most famous
Universities</i>, written and collected for the purpose of
strengthening the King’s position. It was issued in
April and an English translation appeared in the
following November. In June two proclamations were
issued, one for the punishing of “vagabondes and sturdy
beggars,” the other for “dampning” erroneous books and
heresies, and prohibiting the translation of Scripture.
The first of these is printed on one sheet of paper, the
second on a sheet and a half, and the printer was paid
for 1600 of the two £8. 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, that is, one penny each
for the single sheet and a penny halfpenny for the
sheet and a half. In each penny the cost of the paper
represented one-fifth, for “paper royall” which was
then used for printing cost six and eightpence a ream,
the remaining four-fifths representing all the cost of
printing and the profit.</p>

<p>The number of proclamations printed by Berthelet
now in existence is very large, but nothing to compare
with the number which he must really have printed.
Looking at such documents as his three year’s accounts
which have been preserved, and casual entries in
records, it is clear that not a tithe is represented by
existing specimens, though we are more lucky in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
case than in Pynson’s, almost every one of whose
productions in this class has been destroyed.</p>

<p>In 1531 Berthelet issued the first edition of Sir
Thomas Elyot’s <i>Book named the Governour</i>, a work he
frequently reprinted, and he seems to have published all
Elyot’s works, which with their various editions amount
to a considerable number. In 1533 he issued the
<i>Dialogue betwixte two englyshe men, wherof one was
called Salem and the other Bizance</i>. This work written
by Christopher St Germain was an answer to Sir
Thomas More’s <i>Apology</i>, which in its turn was an
attack upon St Germain’s <i>Division of the Spiritualty
and Temporalty</i>.</p>

<p>More’s answer to the first mentioned book was
printed by William Rastell in the same year and
entitled <i>The Debellacyon of Salem and Bizance</i>.</p>

<p>Among the many beautiful borders which Berthelet
used for his books there is one about which a word of
warning should be said. It has engraved upon it the
date 1534, and as it was in use for several years it has
given rise to great confusion in the dating of books.</p>

<p>In 1537 was issued the celebrated <i>Institution of a
Christian Man</i>, called the Bishops’ Book in contradistinction
to the <i>Necessary Doctrine and Erudition for any
Christian Man</i>, or King’s book, issued in 1543. Both
are versions of the same work, but the first has a
Preface of the Prelates to Henry VIII, the second has
an introduction by the King.</p>

<p>In 1542 Sir Thomas Elyot published his Latin
dictionary, and he appears to have issued or intended
to issue a copy on vellum, for in the Bodleian are five
leaves so printed, consisting of the title, the prologue to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
Henry VIII in English, an address to the reader in
Latin, and the table of errata. In 1542 he printed
another book upon vellum, Lily’s <i>Introduction of the
Eight Parts of Speech</i>.</p>

<p>In 1540 a work by Nicholas Borbonius was issued
at Basle in which there is a Latin poem addressed by
the learned author to Berthelet and worded in a most
laudatory style. There is no doubt that Berthelet’s
printing and beautiful type were alone in England able
to rival the work of the foreign printers.</p>

<p>On the accession of Edward VI in 1547, Berthelet lost
his position as King’s Printer, and a new one, Richard
Grafton, was appointed, a custom now for the first time
introduced, as hitherto the appointment had been for
life. For the succeeding eight years of his life we
lose the familiar “Regius Impressor” of his colophons,
and this helps in a small degree in the dating of undated
books. He seems, however, to have become much less
active after the loss of his privilege and probably left
much of the printing business in the hands of his
nephew Thomas Powell, who succeeded him, and his
servants. The various purchases of land which he
made from time to time point to his having built up a
considerable fortune, and apart from his purchases in or
about London he had estates in Hereford.</p>

<p>Besides being printer to Henry VIII Berthelet was
also the Royal bookbinder, and it is hard to speak too
highly of his skill and taste in this direction. The
beauty of the Italian bindings seems to have greatly
struck his fancy and it is supposed that he brought
over some workmen from Venice both to work for him
and to teach his own men. In his accounts rendered to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
the King, some of which fortunately have been
preserved, he speaks of books decorated in the Venetian
manner, and the tools used on them are direct copies of
those used by Aldus of Venice and other contemporary
Italian binders. He made use of one very distinctive
tool, similar to some found on Oriental work, by means
of which the design appears upon the leather plain
while the whole background is gilt. A good deal of the
King’s binding was done in velvet or white leather. To
show the relative value of books and binding take the
following entry, “Item delyuered to the kinges the <span class="allsmcap">XXIII</span>
day of January [1542] a booke of the psalter in Englishe
and Latyne, the price <span class="allsmcap">VIII</span><i>d.</i>, and a booke entitled
Enarracones Evangeliorum Dominicalium, the price
<span class="allsmcap">XII</span><i>d.</i> and for the gorgious byndyng of them backe to
backe <span class="allsmcap">IIII</span><i>s.</i> <span class="allsmcap">IV</span><i>d.</i>” Or again, “Item delyuered unto the
kinges highnes the <span class="allsmcap">XV</span> day of January [1542] a New
Testament in Latyne and a Psalter Englishe and
Latyne bounde backe to backe in white leather,
gorgiously gilted on the leather, the bookes came to
IIs. the byndynge and arabaske drawyng in golde on
the transfile <span class="allsmcap">IIII</span><i>s.</i>”</p>

<p>It is worth noticing, however, that such tenants of
Berthelet as were bookbinders were all Frenchmen.</p>

<p>The date of Berthelet’s death has been only surmised
and never given correctly by bibliographers. Fortunately
he held land from the King, so that at his death
an inquest was held by the escheator, and full and
interesting details are preserved among the <i>Inquisitiones
post mortem</i>. From this source we learn that
his death took place on September 26th, 1555; that
Margaret Berthelet was his second wife, and that his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
eldest son Edward was born on July 24th, 1553. His
will, made two days before his death, was proved on
November 9th, and by it he left estates to his widow
and his two sons Edward and Anthony and legacies to
apprentices, godchildren, and charities. A considerable
bequest also went to his nephew Thomas Powell, presumably
his sister’s son, who succeeded him in business.</p>

<p>We have an account of Berthelet’s funeral, preserved
in Henry Machyn’s diary:</p>

<p>“The sam day at afternone was bered master
Barthelet sqwire and prynter unto Kyng Henry; and
was bered with pennon and cote-armur, and <span class="allsmcap">IIII</span> dosen
of skochyons, and <span class="allsmcap">II</span> whytt branchys and <span class="allsmcap">IIII</span> gylt
candyllstykes and mony prestes and clarkes, and mony
mornars, and all the craftes of prynters, boke-sellers,
and all stassyoners.”</p>

<p>Among all the early presses that of Berthelet was
preeminent for good workmanship. Though he avoided
as far as possible the use of illustrations, all the ornamentation
he used was in good taste, and in beauty
and variety of type he surpassed all printers of the
century.</p>

<p>John Rastell stands quite apart from other early
English printers. Nearly all we know about them
comes from the books they printed while we know little
or nothing about their lives. In the case of Rastell we
know a good deal about his career, but little about his
books. He is said to have been born in London, and
was educated at Oxford, afterwards entering Lincoln’s
Inn and practising the law, in which he was very successful.
He must have been of considerable social
position, for he married Elizabeth More, the sister of
Sir Thomas More. Some time before 1516 he printed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
an edition of the <i>Liber Assisarum</i>, in which he refers
to the projected publication of Fitzherbert’s <i>Great
Abridgement</i>, which appeared in three majestic volumes
in that year.</p>

<p>About 1520 he moved his printing establishment to
a house, “next Paul’s gate,” which he named the
Mermaid, the same sign that he had previously used
elsewhere, and a lawsuit which took place about 1534
in connexion with this house throws considerable light
on the printer’s habits. He appears to have left all
practical work to his assistants, going off to his house
in the country for months at a time and subletting
part of the printing-office to other tenants, among whom
were successively William Bonham, John Heron, Thomas
Kele, and John Gough, all of them stationers.</p>

<p>Up to the year 1526 Rastell had issued only four
dated books, all connected with the law, but in that
year he started out in an entirely new style and
published two extraordinary books, <i>The merry jests of
the widow Edith</i>, and the <i>Hundred mery tales</i>, neither
such as we should have expected from so grave a printer.
About 1529 appeared his <i>Pastime of People</i>, remarkable
for a number of large, clumsy woodcuts. Much has been
written about this book and its variations, and it is
generally asserted that the British Museum copy is the
only perfect one known. There is, however, a very fine
and perfect copy in a private library in this country.
Another curious book he issued is Lucian’s <i>Necromantia</i>,
of which there is a copy at Shirburn Castle.</p>

<p>In 1530 Rastell was drawn into the religious controversies
then becoming violent, and wrote and printed
his <i>New Boke of Purgatory</i> in defence of the Romish
doctrine. This was answered by John Fryth in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
<i>Disputation of Purgatory</i>. Several controversial pamphlets
were written by the two opponents with the
result that Rastell became a convert to the Protestant
religion. This change appears to have been a cause of
trouble to Rastell, who writing to Cromwell in 1536
laments the loss of both business and friends. His law
earnings, which had been over twenty nobles a term,
had fallen to under forty shillings a year and his printing
business had fallen off proportionately, and there is
no book definitely known to exist dated later than 1530.
While most of Rastell’s books are legal in character, he
is also the printer of several curious interludes or plays
such as the <i>Interlude of the four elements</i>, the <i>Interlude
of women</i>, <i>Play concerning Lucretia</i>, Skelton’s <i>Magnificence</i>,
Heywood’s <i>Gentleness and Nobility</i>. The reason
for his printing these is not far to seek. He was
extremely fond of giving performances of plays at his
house and the records have been preserved of a curious
lawsuit brought against him by a theatrical costumier
on account of dresses supplied. Rastell in 1536 freely
expressed his opinions against the paying of tithes, and
perhaps on this account or some other not now known
was thrown into prison, where he shortly after died.
His will dated April 20 and proved October 12 is a
rather remarkable document. He had but little to leave.
His house which had been made over to his wife on their
marriage he bequeaths to her. To his eldest son
William only forty shillings, and to his other son John
a small annuity he had been left by his grandmother.
Other small sums were left to Cromwell and the Lord
Chancellor, and for one of his two executors he nominated
the King himself, who very naturally renounced
probate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>John Rastell’s son William was born about 1508
and went to Oxford in 1525, where though according
to Wood he studied diligently he took no degree. His
first book, issued in 1530, while his father was still
printing, was an edition of Caesar’s <i>Commentaries</i> in
Latin and English. His books, like his father’s, may
be divided into three distinct classes, legal treatises,
controversial works mostly by More, and plays and
interludes. Amongst the latter are Heywood’s <i>Play of
Love</i>, <i>The Pardoner and the Friar</i>, the <i>Play of the
Weather</i>, and <i>Johan Johan the husband and Tib the
wife</i>, copies of them all being in the library of Magdalene
College, Cambridge. Another play, Medwall’s <i>Interlude
of Nature</i>, is in the British Museum. While still a printer
he appears to have studied law, having been admitted
a student in 1532, while he was called to the bar in
1539, where he practised with considerable success.
Unlike his father he remained through life a staunch
Catholic, and when Edward VI succeeded to the throne,
he with many others of his faith sought refuge abroad.
He lived in Louvain until Mary came to the throne
when he returned to England and was rapidly advanced
in his profession, until in 1558 he was made a judge in
the Queen’s Bench, a position which he retained until
1563. Shortly afterwards he returned to Louvain, where
he died on August 27, 1565. After he had given up
printing on his own account William Rastell compiled
and edited a considerable number of important law-books
which continued to be reprinted for a long
period. But the work by which he is best known is
the edition of the complete works of his uncle Sir
Thomas More, published in two volumes folio in 1557
by Richard Tottell.</p>

<p class="c sp">THE STATIONERS OF LONDON AND THE<br>
FOREIGN TRADE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> history of the stationers and the book-trade in
England during the period between 1500 and 1535 is
very obscure and information is difficult to obtain.
That the number of stationers was very considerable
we know from incidental references, and though references
are fairly numerous it is almost impossible in the
present state of our knowledge to combine isolated
facts into any connected story. One point is quite
clear, and every new discovery only tends to emphasize
it, and that is that the book-trade with the Continent
and the dealings of foreign stationers in this country
were infinitely more extensive and important than is
usually supposed. While other countries had a perfectly
adequate supply of printers and stationers of their own
and imported little from their neighbours and practically
nothing from England, here the reverse was the case.
In the time of Richard III there were but four printers
in England, one in Westminster, one in London, one in
Oxford, and one in St Alban’s, so that we can quite
understand the Act of 1484, which was so strong an
encouragement to foreigners to trade here in books, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
the resulting influx of aliens. There were hardly any
restrictions upon foreign trade and there was a ready
market for foreign printed books, so that it is not
surprising that the more important foreign publishers
dealt largely with this country. They appear to have
set up stalls and shops in the neighbourhood of St Paul’s,
where probably the Company of Stationers would not
have power to interfere, and to have placed agents in
charge of them. Besides this they sent agents round
to the various provincial fairs, which at that time were
the greatest business centres in the country, with waggon
loads of books for sale.</p>

<p>Our sources of information about these stationers
are very scattered and also very inadequate. Chief
amongst them are of course the vast masses of documents,
only partially explored, preserved in the Public
Record Office. The list of denizations and the Returns
of Aliens have been printed by the Huguenot Society,
and these give a little information, though unfortunately
the business of the person is often not stated and there
is also the further difficulty of his being entered under
his correct surname, a name which in the ordinary
course of business he rarely made use of himself. The
names too are most carelessly spelt and entered. One
man for instance occurs under the following names,
Frinnorren, Fremorshem, Formishaa, Bringmarshen, and
Vrimors. The lists of denizations are of little use as
far as our present period is concerned, for from 1509 to
1534 only 240 persons are entered, though in 1535 the
large number of 172 was reached owing to pressure
being put upon strangers from the Low Countries. In
this total of 412 only seven are mentioned as having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
business connected with the book-trade; in fact in these
lists of denizations the occupation of only about one in
twenty-five is mentioned. The only returns of aliens
before 1535 are the imperfect ones in connexion with
the subsidies granted to Henry VIII in 1523-25, and
in these the occupations are but very rarely entered.
These returns are therefore useless in giving information
about otherwise unknown stationers; we can only
attempt to trace persons whose names are already
known, and this is rendered the more difficult as people
are arranged anyhow, according to the ward they
inhabited, and there is as yet no index to the book.</p>

<p>Taking all persons residing in England connected
with the book-trade, printers, binders, and stationers,
from 1476 to 1535, it would not, I think, be far from
the mark to state that two-thirds were aliens.</p>

<p>By the Act of 1484 they were exempted from the
restrictions imposed on other workmen, and they could
by residing close to St Paul’s or in the liberties of
St Martin’s or Blackfriars escape from the jurisdiction
of the wardens of the Stationers’ Company or the Lord
Mayor. Though the immigration of foreigners was always
encouraged by Government, it evoked the bitterest
hostility from native craftsmen and was the frequent
cause of those fights and squabbles which culminated
in the famous Mayday riots of 1517. As a case in point
may be mentioned the proceedings in the Star Chamber
about the end of the fifteenth century, when Richard
Pynson sued Harry Squire and others for assaulting
and attempting to murder him and his servants. He
stated that his assistants were so threatened and assaulted
that they had been compelled to leave, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
that consequently his business was at a standstill. This
perhaps may have been the reason for his leaving St
Clement’s parish and settling within the City in 1500.</p>

<p>Many aliens in order to obtain the privileges of
a native took out letters of denization, but these
privileges only commenced from the date of the grant
and were not retrospective as in the case of a patent of
naturalization. Letters of denization allowed a man
to hold, but not to inherit lands; nor did they confer
any benefit on the children born previous to the date
of the grant. In 1512 an Act was passed for levying
a subsidy, and it was ordained that every alien made
a denizen should be rated like a native, but that aliens
not denizened should pay a double rate. In 1515 this
was reversed and denizens again compelled to pay
a double rate.</p>

<p>In 1523 as a set-off for levying a subsidy Henry VIII
gave assent to an Act which ordered that no alien,
denizen or not, using any manner of handicraft within
the realm should from henceforth take any apprentice
except he be born under the King’s obedience; that no
alien should keep more than two alien journeymen; and
that aliens using handicrafts in London and two miles
round should be under the search and reformation of
the wardens of the handicrafts within the City of
London. This Act seems to have been very laxly
enforced, and was practically repeated by a decree of
the Star Chamber in 1528, which contained the additional
clause that no stranger, not being a denizen and
who was not a householder before 15th February 1528,
should keep house or shop where he should exercise
any handicraft. Finally, in 1534 the celebrated Act<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
against foreign printers and binders was passed, whose
terms and effects will be noticed later.</p>

<p>From the earliest times London citizens had been
forbidden by their oath of freedom from taking any
foreign born apprentice, and the Act of 1523 laid
a similar prohibition on all aliens, so that the foreign
element was slowly and surely eliminated.</p>

<p>The authorities of the City of London were strongly
opposed to admitting any foreigners to the freedom of
the City. In a letter from Thomas Berthelet to Morisine
written in 1540 he writes, “My lorde mayor told me ...
that but one stranger born was made freeman these
40 years. I fear the answer is somewhat feigned, for
instead of one stranger made freeman this 40 years,
there have been six or more. Perhaps they do it to
show that they esteem not the liberty of London so
light as to admit a stranger born so suddenly when the
King’s natural subjects must do so long and painful
a service before they can enjoy it.”</p>

<p>The great centre of trade during this period was
St Paul’s Churchyard, and the shops there were of two
kinds. There were the substantial houses round the
cathedral, where the printer or stationer could carry on
his business and dwell, but clustered in every direction
against the very walls of the church were booths and
sheds and stalls. These were simply “lock up” shops
of one story, many with flat roofs for people to stand on
to view processions, and were used by booksellers and
such printers as had printing-offices elsewhere. In
Strype’s life of Parker we have a description of a shop
set up at a later date by Day the printer, “Whereupon
he got framed a neat handsome shop. It was but little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
and low and flat-roofed, and leaded like a terrace, railed
and posted, fit for men to stand upon in any triumph or
show, but could not in any wise hurt and deface the
same. This cost him forty or fifty pounds.”</p>

<p>Even the most important printers had stalls before
their houses, for we read in an account of a lawsuit in
1536 resulting from an attack on some Frenchmen in
Fleet Street, that one of them, endeavouring to escape,
concealed himself under the King’s Printer’s (<i>i.e.</i>
Berthelet’s) stall. Thomas Symonds, a stationer, who
was a witness in a lawsuit in 1514, speaks of himself
as standing before his stall at seven in the morning,
not so very early an hour at a period when the Privy
Council assembled at eight.</p>

<p>Though London was the head-quarters of the trade,
the stationers did not confine their attention to the
City, but travelled about the country attending the
various fairs, where so far as we can judge from such
few early accounts as are still preserved, a very considerable
portion of their trade was done. Great fairs
such as that of Sturbridge brought booksellers from far
and near, and so great was their fame as a bookselling
centre that even at the end of the seventeenth century
the great London dealers sent down vast consignments
of books which were sold by auction by the leading
London auctioneers. All the more important stationers
too paid frequent visits to the Continent and attended
the great fair at Frankfurt, the principal opportunity
for seeing all the latest publications and the recognised
time and place for the transaction of business.</p>

<p>In treating of these early stationers I propose first
of all to take those who lived and carried on business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
solely in London, and then to pass on to those who
traded both in London and on the Continent. Of very
many we know little but the name, and these I can but
pass over, touching only on those who are known as
publishers of books, or about whom we have some
definite information.</p>

<p>The first of these is a certain John Boudins, or
Baldwin as he called himself in English, who lived in
the parish of St Clement’s, Eastcheap. We know of
him from one book, an edition of the Sarum <i>Expositio
Hymnorum et Sequentiarum</i> which was printed for him
at Paris by André Bocard in 1502, and which is
apparently the first edition with the preface of Badius
Ascensius. Boudins died shortly after the publication
of the book, for his will dated October 11, 1501, was
proved March 30, 1503. He was a native of the Low
Countries.</p>

<p>A certain Andrew Rue, who had succeeded his
brother John, who had died in 1493, was a stationer like
his brother in St Paul’s Churchyard. He died in 1517
leaving legacies to relations in Frankfort and others.
To Thomas Wallis, priest of St Faith’s, he leaves a bound
copy of the book of sermons called <i>Dormi Secure</i>, and
to David Owen of the same church a copy of Quentin’s
sermons. Two of the executors of his will were
John Reynes and Joyce Pelgrim, both to be noticed
shortly.</p>

<p>Richard Nele is mentioned as a stationer in a document
of 1525, when he petitioned to be transferred to
the Company of Ironmongers.</p>

<p>John Taverner, another stationer, was paid £4 in
1521 for binding the books for use in the Chapel Royal.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
He died in 1531 and his will was proved in November
of that year. In the year following John Sedley,
Warden of the Craft of Stationers, died.</p>

<p>It would be useless here, as well as extremely
tedious, to go on enumerating the names of stationers
of whom we know so little, so I will pass on to some
about whom we possess some more definite information.</p>

<p>Joyce Pelgrim, a native of the Low Countries, was
early settled in London and in 1504 issued the
first book specially printed for him, an edition of the
<i>Ortus Vocabulorum</i> printed at Paris by Jean Barbier,
who had himself but lately left England. This book is
only known from some fragments preserved in a binding
in Lord Crawford’s library. Before 1506 he entered
into partnership with Henry Jacobi, and the two,
assisted with money by a wealthy merchant, William
Bretton, a grocer and member of the Staple at
Calais, issued several books connected with the service
of the Church. The first and most important was an
edition of the <i>Constitutiones Provinciales</i> of William
Lindewode, issued some time after May, 1506. It was
printed at Paris by Wolfgang Hopyl in a most ornate
manner and the title-page is one of the most beautiful
to be found in an early book, the combination of small
woodcuts, woodcut borders, printer’s devices, and red
and black printing forming a most rich and harmonious
whole. Two service books, a Sarum <i>Horae</i> and a
<i>Psalterium cum Hymnis</i>, followed at the beginning of
1507. In 1510 for the same patron they issued the
<i>Pupilla Oculi</i> of Joannes de Burgo and the <i>Speculum
Spiritualium</i> of Richard of Hampole printed by Hopyl,
as well as another <i>Horae</i> printed by Kerver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>On their own account the stationers did little,
issuing in 1507 and 1508 three school books. Pelgrim,
after the publication of the <i>Ortus Vocabulorum</i> of 1504
does not seem to have issued any books on his own
account, but he was always connected with William
Bretton, and acted as his agent in 1514. He lived in
Paul’s Churchyard at the sign of St Anne, though
nothing is heard of the shop after 1506. It may be
that it was one of the many swept away to make room
for the new schools built by Colet, for we know that
the Trinity, where Pelgrim’s partner Jacobi lived, was
close by.</p>

<p>Henry Jacobi, probably a Frenchman, was apparently
a much more important stationer than Pelgrim
and some things point to his having been a citizen of
London. He is first mentioned in 1504 as a stationer,
and in 1505, as we learn from a note in a MS. in the
British Museum, he supplied a large number of books
to the King. Shortly after this he joined as a partner
with Pelgrim and together they printed books for
William Bretton. In 1509 he appears to have separated
from his partner, for in the colophon of the <i>Ortus
Vocabulorum</i> printed by Pynson his name is found
alone. In 1510 he went over to France and his name
is found in the colophons of some small tracts of
Savonarola, printed in Paris in 1510 and 1511 by
Badius Ascensius. In 1512 he was back in London,
and issued an edition of the Sarum <i>Diurnale</i> printed
for him at Paris by Hopyl. Francis Byrckman also
appears to have been concerned in the publication of
this book for his device is printed at the end. About
this time Jacobi issued a <i>Legenda Francisci</i> printed for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
him by Jean Barbier at Paris and a <i>Regula Benediciti</i>
printed by W. de Worde.</p>

<p>Soon after 1512 Jacobi migrated to Oxford, where
he opened a shop with his old sign of the Trinity and
published there an edition of the <i>Formalitates</i> of
Antonius Sirectus, printed for him in London by
Wynkyn de Worde. A copy of the title-page was
found by Mr Proctor in a binding in New College,
Oxford, and a copy of the book itself, minus the
greater part of the title, was subsequently traced in the
British Museum. Jacobi did not long survive his
migration to Oxford, but died there in 1514, and on
the 11th December administration of his effects was
granted to William Bretton through his agent Joyce
Pelgrim, while his will was proved the same year in
London.</p>

<p>The devices used by Pelgrim and Jacobi were four
in number. In the books printed for W. Bretton a
large block containing his coat of arms is used. After
its first appearance a mistake in the heraldry was
discovered and the shield was cut out and a new one
inserted in the block, a very early example of what is
technically known as plugging. It is curious that this
device, though a private coat of arms, was afterwards
copied and used as a device by the Paris printer Egidius
Gourmont. The device used by Pelgrim and Jacobi
together was a blank shield on a ribbon with the motto
“Nosce teipsum” with their initials and marks on either
side. Jacobi used in the Sirectus a representation of
the Trinity with his mark and name in full below on
a ribbon. In the books printed for them by Hopyl
another device of the Trinity is found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>The bindings produced by the Trinity stationers
were of two classes. The folio books were tooled with
small dies, the smaller books stamped with panel
stamps. Several copies of the <i>Lyndewode</i> of 1506 are
in existence tooled with identical dies, and one of these
copies is lined with unused sheets of the <i>Ortus Vocabulorum</i>
printed for Pelgrim in 1504. The panel stamps
all appear to have belonged to Henry Jacobi, for at
present none have been found with Pelgrim’s mark.
Like many other stationers of the time he used the two
panels, having on one side a shield bearing the arms of
France and England and supported by a dragon and
greyhound and on the other the Tudor rose between
two scrolls, supported by angels and containing these
verses,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Hec rosa virtutis de celo missa sereno</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Eternum florens, regia sceptra feret.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Of these he had three series. In the first his
initials and mark are quite plain and simple, just as we
find them printed on the title-page of the <i>Lyndewode</i>.
In the second series the ornament was a little more
profuse and the mark and initials are omitted under
the rose, leaving the space blank. In the last series the
ornamentation is more complicated and the initials and
mark are so much elaborated that the I of Iacobi looks
almost like an A. In conjunction with the second
series of panels a square die containing the figure of a
dragon is found which had belonged to Caxton and
must have been obtained from W. de Worde. Two
other panels which belonged to Jacobi are much more
foreign in appearance. On one is a figure of Christ
seated on a tomb surrounded by the emblems of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
Passion, on the other Our Lady of Pity. Round both
runs a legend, and at the end of the second the binder’s
initials, H.I., occur joined by a knot.</p>

<p>The example of this binding in the Bodleian, very
much rubbed and worn, is on some small tracts by
Savonarola, two of which were printed for Jacobi in
1510. The binding has on the end fly-leaf an inscription
saying that the book was bought by John Yonge, “Aconensis,”
in 1510, and this must be after September 10
of that year, when Yonge was appointed Master of St
Thomas of Acres. If Jacobi really was in Paris in 1510
and 1511, this book must have been bound there, and
perhaps these two small panels were cut abroad for the
purpose of stamping these small volumes for which his
other panels would have been too large.</p>

<p>Though Jacobi died in 1514 and Pelgrim is not
mentioned after this date, the business at the sign of
the Trinity still continued. This we know from a
unique but unfortunately imperfect book in the
Bodleian. It is called “<i>Donate and accidence for
children enprynted at Parys. Anno Domini 1515.</i>” The
imprint on the title states that it was to be sold at
Paris at the sign of the Striped Ass by Philippus de
Couvelance and in St Paul’s Churchyard at the sign of
St Katherine or the Trinity. The last leaf which
might have contained a colophon is wanting. This
Philip de Couvelance was apparently the son of Jean de
Cowlance, whose device was the striped ass (asinus
riguatus) and who was the same person as Joannes
Confluentinus or Jean de Coblentz, whose name occurs
frequently in the prefaces of early books.</p>

<p>Birckman perhaps may have had something to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
with the sign of the Trinity, for he seems to have been
in partnership with Jacobi in 1512 and used the device
of the Trinity on some of the service books of English
use which he issued. However by 1518 the shop was
in the occupation of Henry Pepwell, who has been
noticed before.</p>

<p>The sign of the “striped ass” commemorates the
exhibition of a zebra, the first seen in France, which
was shown at the Saint-Germain fair towards the close
of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>John Reynes, in many ways the best known of
these early stationers, was a native of Wageningen in
Gueldres and took out letters of denization on June 7,
1510. Though described in the Subsidy rolls of 1523
as a stationer, he appears to have undertaken other
kinds of business, for in 1524 we find him supplying
cloth and cotton at the funeral of Sir Thomas Lovell.
In 1527 he began his business as publisher by issuing
a magnificent edition of Higden’s <i>Polycronicon</i>, printed
for him at Southwark by Peter Treveris, which is
remarkable for the excellence of the illustrations. Very
fortunately too his mark is engraved at the foot of the
title-page and thus gives us the only clue by which
we can identify his large series of stamped bindings.
In this same year, Reynes in partnership with W. de
Worde and Ludovicus Suethon, which name is I believe
a misspelling for Sutton, commissioned a magnificent
edition of the Sarum <i>Gradual</i>, which was printed for
them at Paris by Nicolas Prevost, and of which the
fine copy, formerly Gough’s, is in the Bodleian. In
1530 another service book was printed for him abroad,
an edition of the <i>Psalterium cum Hymnis</i> for the use of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
Sarum and York. Ten years later he issued an <i>Introductorie
for to lerne to rede Frenche</i> written by Giles
Duwes, sometime librarian to Henry VIII, and Tutor
of the French language to the Princess Mary. The
latest book which Reynes issued was a Sarum <i>Processional</i>
which was printed for him at Antwerp by
the widow of Christopher van Ruremond.</p>

<p>Reynes was certainly in his time the most important
stationer of foreign birth settled in England, and
his goods valued in 1523 at £40. 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> had risen in
1541 and 1544 to £100. The only other foreigner of
like importance was Arnold Birckman, who, however,
was not settled in this country, but only paid it passing
visits and carried on business by an agent.</p>

<p>Reynes’s chief fame now, however, rests on his bindings,
which are the most frequently found and best known
amongst all the early English series. The commonest
are those ornamented with a broad roll containing his
mark and figures of a hound, a falcon, and a bee, with
sprays of foliage and flowers. He had also several
series of panels. One pair is particularly good. The
first represents the baptism of Christ, who stands in the
stream while St John, kneeling, pours the water on His
head. The other is a spirited picture of St George and
the dragon fighting within an enclosure, round which
run various animals and huntsmen. Below are the
initials I. R. joined by a knot which must stand for
John Reynes, as I have found these two panels used
in conjunction with his roll on a binding in the library
of St John’s College, Oxford.</p>

<p>A more ambitious panel contains what is called the
“Arma Redemptoris Mundi,” the emblems of the Passion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
displayed heraldically upon a shield with two unicorns
as supporters, and two small shields with Reynes’s mark
and initials. The companion panel is divided into two
parts, one containing the shield with the arms of
England and France supported by the dragon and greyhound,
the other the Tudor rose with the scrolls bearing
the usual verses and supported by angels. These contain,
besides Reynes’s initials and mark, a shield with
the arms of the City of London, so that when these
were cut he was probably a freeman.</p>

<p>The last pair, which are late in style and were
probably only made for him near the end of his career,
contain busts of warriors in medallions between renaissance
pillars, connected by ornamental arches, and the
whole enclosed within an ornamental border. In the
centre between the medallions is the binder’s mark.</p>

<p>Reynes died at the beginning of 1544 and his will,
made April 8th, 1542, was proved on February 26th. It
is a long document and contains many points of interest.
His two apprentices, Thomas Holwarde and Edward
Sutton, are to receive on coming out of their apprenticeship
one hundred shillingsworth of books to be valued
according to the way that Arnold and John Birckman
sell them to the booksellers. Edward Wright and
Robert Holder, his assistants, are left ten pounds in
books on condition that they work for Lucy Reynes,
the widow, for two years and assist her to realise the
stock. Money is left to the poor and for a breakfast to
the stationers who come to the funeral, and the residue
to the widow Lucy Reynes. It is clear from the fact
that Reynes had English apprentices, and from the way
he speaks of the stationers, that he had been made a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
freeman and member of the Company in spite of his
foreign birth.</p>

<p>Lucy Reynes did not long survive her husband, for
her will, dated April 28, 1548, was proved October 25,
1549. She, like her husband, requested to be buried
in the Pardon Churchyard near St Paul’s.</p>

<p>Another stationer and binder whose work can fortunately
be identified is Thomas Symonds, a stationer of
St Paul’s Churchyard. His name first occurs in 1514
when he was a witness in a lawsuit quoted by Foxe in
his <i>Book of Martyrs</i>. He was employed by the officials
of London Bridge, and in their accounts for 1525-6 is
the entry “paid to Thomas Symonds for binding in
boards 17 quires in parchment containing 17 accounts
of the bridge works, 6<i>s.</i>” This original binding is still
preserved and is ornamented with a broad roll containing
the binder’s mark, a castle and portcullis, a fleur-de-lys,
a unicorn, a rose, a pomegranate and the royal
arms.</p>

<p>Lewis Sutton was apparently a very important
stationer, and must I think be identified with the
Ludovicus Suethon who in partnership with John
Reynes and W. de Worde commissioned the great
Sarum <i>Gradual</i> printed for them at Paris by Prevost
in 1527. In foreign printed books mistakes in names
are not uncommon, and the rare Christian name Lewis
combined with two such similar sounding names as
Suethon and Sutton, renders the suggestion probable.
In 1526 he and Henry Pepwell were the two wardens
of the Company of Stationers, which shows that he must
have held a high position in the trade. In 1534-5 he
was defendant along with Richard Draper, warden of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
the Goldsmiths, in an action brought by John Gough
and John Rastell the printer concerning the latter’s
printing-office. A later notice of him occurs in the
letters and papers of Henry VIII under the date of
August 12, 1539. “Receipt by Lewys Sutton, bookbinder
of London, of 5 marks from William Hatton of
Haldenby for lands in Northamptonshire sold to him.”
The will of a Lewis Sutton described as belonging to
the parish of St Michael le Querne, London, and dated
1541, is amongst those preserved in the Prerogative
Court of Canterbury, and is probably that of the stationer.
There was another Sutton named Nicholas
who was a stationer in London and died shortly before
1531, who lived in St Paul’s Churchyard and was probably
related to the stationers named Toy.</p>

<p>A stamped binding is known having upon it the
initials N. S. followed by a tun, apparently a rebus on
the name N. Sutton, and may very likely be his work.</p>

<p>Another person who ought to be mentioned, though
neither printer nor stationer, is William Marshall, quoted
by many writers as both. He was strongly interested
in the Reformation, and spent both time and money in
procuring the printing of books in support of the movement.
He was a friend of Cromwell, who assisted him
with money, and there are in the State papers many
interesting letters from the one to the other relating
to the publication of such works as the <i>Gift of Constantine</i>
printed by Godfray, and <i>Erasmus on the Creed</i> by
Redman, issued in 1534; <i>De veteri et novo Deo</i>, printed
by Byddell, and the <i>Defence of Peace</i> by Wyer, both
of 1535. Of this latter book he sent twenty-four copies
to the monks of the Charterhouse, which they, under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
the order of their superior, returned, with the exception
of one copy which they burnt. Two books, his
<i>Pictures and Ymages</i> and <i>The Chrysten Bysshop and
Counterfayte Bysshop</i>, were apparently printed by Gough,
though according to Herbert the latter book has a distinct
colophon “Emprynted by Wyllyam Marshall.”
The most beautiful book printed for him was the
reformed <i>Prymer</i> of 1535, the work of John Byddell.
It is much superior to the usual work of the time, and
at least three copies are known printed upon vellum.
Like William Bretton, Marshall has printed at the end
of some of the books he had commissioned a large
woodcut representing his coat of arms.</p>

<p>John Growte, stationer and bookbinder, lived in the
Blackfriars next the church door. In 1532 and 1533
he commissioned the widow of Thielman Kerver to
print for him two editions of the Sarum <i>Horae</i>, which
were followed by another in 1534. Growte is identical
with the mythical Rouen stationer Jean Groyat, an
error which has arisen through the misreading of a
colophon. An edition of the <i>Horae</i> was printed in
1536 at Rouen “per Nicolaum le Roux pro Johanne
groyat et Johanne marchant in parochia sancti Macuti
ad signum duarum unicornium manente.” A hasty
glance has assured someone that Groyat and Marchant
were partners living at the sign of the two unicorns,
overlooking the fact that the last word used in the
colophon “manente” must apply to Marchant alone.
Groyat may very well be the proper spelling of
Growte’s name, for he was a foreigner, as we know
from his being entered in the Returns of Aliens.</p>

<p>During the period of which we are now treating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
the presses of Paris and Rouen were actively at work
producing books intended for the London market. At
Paris, Hopyl, Kerver, Petit, Chevallon, Hardouyn,
Prevost, Pigouchet, Higman, Rembolt, in fact all the
best known printers and stationers were thus employed.
At Rouen we find Morin, Caillard, Olivier,
Violette, Bernard, Cousin, Richard, and others, and
when we consider that many printed twenty or thirty
different editions, we can arrive at some idea of the
magnitude of the trade. The most important of the
Paris printers was Hopyl; his <i>Lyndewode</i>, his Sarum
<i>Missals</i>, and above all his <i>Antiphoner</i>, are splendid
specimens of work which no English printer of the
time could have attempted to rival. Prevost among
other books is represented by a magnificent <i>Gradual</i>.
Chevallon issued the great Sarum <i>Breviary</i> of 1531.
Pigouchet and Kerver continued the work they had
done so well in the previous century, and issued many
editions of the Sarum <i>Horae</i>, while Higman and Rembolt
printed <i>Missals</i>.</p>

<p>Among the Rouen printers Martin Morin undoubtedly
took the leading position for beautiful work.
He and Olivier produced a large number of Sarum
<i>Missals</i> remarkable for their fine printing. With
regard to these missals there is one point to which
I should like to draw attention. Both Morin and
Olivier possessed a very large initial M for the title
Missale, round the middle stroke of which their name
is engraved, Morin or Holivier. Now these letters
being practically indestructible, passed to their successors
and were still used. This at any rate in the
case of Olivier has given rise to considerable confusion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
for he is quoted as the printer of books, as for instance
the York <i>Missal</i> of 1530, which were issued long after
he was dead. Among other printers and stationers
connected with the English trade may be mentioned
Macé, Bernard, Cousin, Violette, and Caillard.</p>

<p>Almost the entire French output consisted of liturgical
books. Verard however issued three—well, British—books,
for two were in Scottish, and we have it on
Pynson’s authority that no one could understand them.
The third was Barclay’s translation of Gringore’s <i>Castle
of Labour</i>, printed when Barclay was himself in Paris
about 1503.</p>

<p>Besides these a few grammatical tracts were issued,
Violette issued an English Donatus and Jacques Cousin
a Stanbridge at Rouen.</p>

<p>The series of beautiful liturgical books which came
from the presses of Paris and Rouen afford us information
also about many visiting foreign stationers. The
<i>Missal</i> issued in 1500 by Jean du Pré, but generally
ascribed through a misreading of the colophon to 1502,
speaks of several new prayers just brought over from
England by Jean Antoine the stationer. A Terence
of 1504, of which the only copy known is in the
University Library (picked up from a small old-book
shop in Liverpool), and a Sarum <i>Breviary</i> of 1507 were
printed for several stationers living in London, one of
whom was a certain Michael Morin, no doubt a relative
of the famous Rouen printer Martin Morin. Another
stationer whose name is found in the Terence is
John Brachius, but his name occurs nowhere else, and
I have not been able to find out anything about him.
Guillaume Candos, at whose cost a Sarum <i>Missal</i> was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
printed in 1509 by Pierre Violette, was apparently in
England for a time. Another Sarum <i>Missal</i> quoted
by Herbert, of which I can trace no copy, was printed
for W. de Worde and Michael de Paule, both living in
London. Jean Richard of Rouen, who printed so many
fine Sarum service books, also came over and was one
of the parties in a lawsuit in England at the beginning
of the century. From another lawsuit we find that
Frederick Egmont, an important stationer of London
in the fifteenth century, was still in England, after 1500.
I think it will be found, as more documents come
to light, that all the principal foreign stationers paid
visits to this country or kept agents in London. In
very many foreign printed service books we find the
expression “to be bought of the booksellers in Paul’s
Churchyard.” I do not know whether that is the
equivalent of the modern “to be obtained of all booksellers”
or whether it only refers to a small clique of
foreign stationers.</p>

<p>Of all the foreign stationers who traded in this
country none was more important than Francis Regnault.
He was the son of an earlier Francis Regnault,
and when a young man started as a stationer in London
towards the end of the fifteenth century. Though he
returned to Paris about 1496 he still continued to keep
a shop in London and probably paid frequent visits to
this country. When on the death of his father, about
1518, he succeeded to the great printing business, his
English sympathies at once showed themselves, and
from that time onward he poured out a continuous
flood of books for the English market. Between the
years 1519 and 1535 by far the larger portion of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
service books produced for England came from his
presses. The Act of 1534, and perhaps other causes,
seem to have hampered his business to a serious degree
and in 1536 he addressed a letter to Cromwell on the
subject. The writer states that he lived in London
forty years ago and since returned to Paris and continued
his trade as bookseller in London, and likewise
printed missals, breviaries, and Hours of the use of
Sarum and other books. That he has entertained at
his house in Paris honourable people of London and
other towns of England. He understands that the
English booksellers wish to prevent him printing such
books and to confiscate what he has already printed,
though he has never been forbidden to do so, but his
books well received. He asks permission to continue
to sell the said “usaiges” and other books in London
and the neighbourhood, and asks Cromwell to speak on
his behalf to the King, the chancellor and others. He
adds that if any faults have been found in his books
he will amend them. Considering the date of this
letter, it seems much more probable that his troubles
were caused not so much by the jealousy of the English
booksellers as by the falling off in the demand for the
class of books he produced.</p>

<p>Besides printing on his own account, Regnault
printed also for English printers. In 1534 he printed
for Berthelet the <i>Interpretatio Psalmorum Omnium</i>
of Joannes Campensis, and in 1538 an edition of the
English <i>New Testament</i> for Grafton and Whitchurch,
edited by Coverdale, and intended to supersede the
incorrect version printed shortly before at Southwark
by James Nicholson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>One of the latest important undertakings on which
Regnault was engaged was a folio edition of the English
Bible printed for Grafton and Whitchurch and overseen
by Coverdale. The work was progressing favourably
when pressure was brought to bear upon the French
authorities, and the press, type, and the sheets already
printed were seized, most of the printed matter being
burnt. By the influence of Cromwell the type seems
to have been recovered and conveyed to London, where
the work was finished in 1539. The usual account
speaks of the printers and presses being brought over
as well, but that must, I think, be a little poetical
exaggeration, for the presses of England were surely by
that time adequate for such work.</p>

<p>In the library of St John’s College, Cambridge, is
the unique copy on vellum which was printed specially
for Cromwell. The titles, woodcuts, and all the initials
throughout the volume are beautifully illuminated.</p>

<p>Regnault again attempted to obtain some favour
for his books in England, and a letter was written to
Cromwell by Coverdale and Grafton on his behalf.
Speaking of him they write, “Whereas of long tyme
he hath bene an occupier into England more than
xl yere, he hath allwayes provyded soche bookes for
England as they moost occupied, so that he hath a
great nombre at this present in his handes as Prymers
in Englishe, Missoles with other soche like: wherof now
(by the company of the Booksellers in London) he is
utterly forbydden to make sale to the utter undoying
of the man. Wherfore most humbly we beseke your
lordshippe to be gracious and favourable unto him,
that he may have lycence to sell those which he hath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
done allready, so that hereafter he prynte no moo in
the english tong, onlesse he have an english man that is
lerned to be his corrector.”</p>

<p>From the concluding sentence it would appear that
a special attack had been made on these foreign printed
service books because of their incorrect printing, and
everyone who has examined the very numerous editions
of the <i>Horae ad usum Sarum</i> printed abroad must
admit that any complaints were fully justified. The
booksellers evidently succeeded in their opposition, for
no more Paris printed service books came to this
country until the reign of Mary.</p>

<p>A solitary fragment, rescued like so many others
from the binding of a book and now preserved in the
Bodleian, is the only record we possess of the presence
in England, nominally at any rate, of one of the most
important Paris booksellers of the sixteenth century.
The fragment consists of the first and last leaves of
a little tract of four leaves entitled, “<i>Psalterium beate
marie virginis cum articulis incarnationis passionis et
resurrexionis domini nostri iesu xpi nuper editum</i>.” Of
the liturgical interest of the fragment this is not the
place to speak; our interest lies in the colophon, which
runs “Imprynted at London in Flete aley the .xxi. daye
of October by Simon Voter.” This, I take it, can refer
to no one but the celebrated printer of that name, but
whether the colophon exactly means all that it states
is another matter. It would seem unlikely that so
important a man should come to London to print so
small a tract, and besides it has no appearance of
English work. Like many others, he had probably
an agent of his own in London and printing the tract<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
in Paris sent it to London for sale. The type in which
it is printed, a neat black letter, is what may be called
a stock type, that is, it was made by a man who made
type-founding his business and supplied various printers.
On the title-page is a woodcut of the Assumption of
the Virgin which I have seen in no other book, but
which I hope may some day be the means of settling
the real printer.</p>

<p>While speaking of these French stationers and their
work, there is one book which though without name
of printer or place was printed in English and intended
for the English market and should certainly not be
passed over, especially as it is in some ways the most
remarkable book of the period. It is entitled <i>The
Passion of our Lord Jesu Christ with the Contemplations</i>,
and was translated from the French in 1508 and printed
about the same time. The language is peculiar and
uncouth and mixed up with foreign expressions. The
book is a very large quarto equal in size to the ordinary
small folio of the time, printed in double columns.
But the extraordinary point about the book is the
illustrations, large full-page woodcuts some twenty in
number and obviously and unmistakeably German.
The style of woodcutting, the dresses, the high-gabled
houses, the storks nesting on the chimney-tops are all
distinctive. This last gave the immediate suggestion
of Strasburg and a very little search showed that the
illustrations were almost exact copies of a series engraved
by Urs Graf and first published in a volume
entitled <i>Passio Jesu Christi</i> printed in 1506 by Knoblouch
at Strasburg.</p>

<p>One of these cuts, the Crucifixion, occurs in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
York <i>Manual</i> printed ostensibly by Wynkyn de Worde in
1509 for John Gachet and James Ferrebouc. Although
the colophon of the book states emphatically twice
over that it was printed in London for De Worde
I have always thought it was printed abroad, not only
because of this woodcut, but because the type both of
text and music is not De Worde’s and because the device
used in it is one only found in his foreign printed books
and therefore presumably kept abroad.</p>

<p>Much seems to point to Paris as the place of production
of both books, and a further piece of evidence
exists in the fact that these cuts are found in an edition
of <i>Les Exposicions des epistres et evangiles</i> printed for
Verard in 1511-12. I wrote on the subject of the
English book to M. Delisle, who very kindly made some
enquiries at the Bibliothèque Nationale, but at present
no French original can be traced nor could the Keeper
of the Prints throw any further light on the history of
the cuts. The translation would appear to have been
done in England as it was done at the command of
Henry VII. The only perfect copy known is in the
Bodleian, but there are fragments in bindings in several
libraries, among others Westminster Abbey and Corpus
Christi College, Cambridge.</p>

<p>While a serious blow was struck at the French
book trade by the Act of 1534, which attacked the
supply, Henry VIII himself did it much more serious
damage by destroying the demand. Almost the whole
of the trade done by the French booksellers consisted
in the production and supply of service books; and the
great change which was taking place in the services
was gradually tending to do away with their use. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
this time we find no more editions of the old <i>Breviary</i>
or the <i>Missal</i> produced at all, except for a short time
in Mary’s reign, and these two books had been mainly
produced in France. The <i>Horae</i> or <i>Primer</i> still continued
in use, but its character was so much changed
and so much English introduced into it that it was as
well produced in England. By this time too the taste
for the elaborate borders and illustrations and sumptuous
printing which marked the earlier work seems
to have disappeared, so that as a general rule the
editions sent over from abroad were as inartistic and
badly printed as our own.</p>

<p>The competition of the Low Countries must also
have had something to do with the decay of French
trade, for the Antwerp stationers boasted they could
undersell anyone, and certainly such later service books
as were printed abroad were printed at Antwerp.</p>

<p>Be the explanation what it may, the fact is clear
that the date which saw the passing of the Act of 1534
concerning books, saw the end of French book production
for the English market.</p>

<p class="c sp">THE STATIONERS FROM ANTWERP AND THE<br>
BOOKBINDERS.</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">Though</span> in regard to books printed for the English
market France is most important in numerical strength,
it ranks far below the Low Countries in point of
interest. The productions of Paris and Rouen consisted
almost entirely of liturgical books and a few
dictionaries and grammars. From Antwerp on the
other hand from the time of Gerard Leeu in the
fifteenth century onwards there was an almost unbroken
output of books in the English language. Leeu
began with reprints of some of Caxton’s books, Adrian
van Berghen, the printer of <i>Arnold’s Chronicle</i>, followed,
then came Jan van Doesborch with his many curious
little English books, and then, most interesting of all,
the various editions of the English <i>Testament</i> and the
multitude of controversial works caused by the religious
dissensions in England.</p>

<p>Of Gerard Leeu, “an exceedingly pleasant person”
as Erasmus called him, and his English books, I gave
some account in an earlier Lecture; so I must begin
the account of the sixteenth century with Adrian
van Berghen, Adryan of Barrowe as he calls himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
in his English imprints. He apparently began to print
about the close of the fifteenth century, living in a shop
with the sign of the Great Golden Mortar in the
Market; in 1507 he had moved to the Corn Market
behind the Town Hall, and at a later date he settled
in a house by the Cammerpoort Bridge with the sign
of the Golden Missal. In 1535 like many another
stationer he got into trouble in religious matters and
was accused of keeping and selling Lutheran books, of
which a number had been found in his house. In vain
he protested that he knew nothing about them and
that they had been secretly put there by some
enemy, for after a lengthy trial he was found guilty and
on January 3, 1536, was sentenced to leave the state of
Antwerp within three days, and perform a pilgrimage to,
of all places in the world, Nicosia in Cyprus. Nothing
further is known of him. But Adrian of Barrowe will
ever be had in grateful remembrance as the printer of
<i>Arnold’s Chronicle</i>, for in this he first published to the
world the beautiful ballad of the “Nut-browne Maid.”</p>

<p>A description of <i>Arnold’s Chronicle</i> is a difficult
matter to undertake. It was one of the books which
served as weapons to the late Professor Chandler
in his campaign against the subject catalogue of the
Bodleian. It contains a list of the London sheriffs, and a
guide to writing business letters, a list of the London
churches, recipes for making ink, and a variety of other
miscellaneous information. And in the middle, apropos
of nothing, “The Nut-browne Maid.” Chronicle is a
misleading title, for the work is really a commonplace
book and a very interesting one. Fortunately this
and the later edition printed about 1520 by Peter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
Treveris are fairly common books and available in a considerable
number of libraries. There is a copy in the
Parker collection in the library of Corpus Christi College,
Cambridge, interesting to the typographer from an
accidental cause. The printer when inking the forme
accidentally pulled out a type which has fallen sideways
upon the top of the rest and impressed on the page an
exact full-length image of itself. From the few early
examples of such faults as are known it has been
possible to obtain a good deal of information as to
the sizes and shapes of early types.</p>

<p>Adrian van Berghen printed also an English <i>Almanack</i>
for 1529 and an edition of Holt’s <i>Lac Puerorum</i>.
This latter is known only from fragments, and some
of these have a curious connexion with Cambridge.
Among a parcel of unidentified fragments in the Bodleian
I came across some pieces of this book which
had at one time formed the pad or boards of a binding.
From the well indented marks on the paper it was easy
to identify the panel which had been stamped upon
the binding as the picture of St Nicholas raising the
three children, with the name underneath, Nicolas
Spiernick, used by Nicolas Speryng, the Cambridge
stationer. But the interesting point about the fragments
was that on one of them was written the name
of N. Speyrinck, thus connecting the Spiernick of the
binding with the name as used at Cambridge, Speryng.
It is perhaps not strictly right to have included Adrian
van Berghen, since he had not so far as we know any
personal connexion with England; but the interest of
one at least of the English books which he printed
must serve as an excuse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>The next printer to be considered is Francis Birckman,
the first of the numerous bookselling family of
that name, and himself a very important stationer. He
was a native of Cologne, who had his headquarters at
Antwerp while he carried on business in several other
towns, and a great part of his trade was with England.
Panzer in his <i>Annales Typographici</i> does not mention
him before the year 1513, but at an earlier date he was
issuing books for the English market and had a shop
in St Paul’s Churchyard. He is first mentioned in
1504, when in partnership with a certain Gerard Cluen
of Amersfoordt in Utrecht he issued a Sarum <i>Missal</i>.
Beyond the mention of his name in this one book we
know nothing of Gerard Cluen, but I think we may
take for granted that he was a relation of Birckman’s
wife, Gertrude van Amersfoordt. Of the <i>Missal</i>
but two copies are known, one in Trinity College,
Dublin, and the other, recently acquired, in the British
Museum. Between 1504 and 1510 Birckman’s name
is not found, but after that date he issued books continuously
until about 1528. The history of the Birckman
family is very confused, but I cannot help thinking
that there were two branches both using the same
Christian names. It seems impossible otherwise to
account for the large number of books printed in
various places almost at the same time, unless they
were merely commissioned and Birckman’s name put
in the imprint. The Birckmans were certainly always
travelling about; at a little later date I find one of them
within three months at Antwerp, Cologne, London,
Oxford, and Cambridge. It is interesting to notice that
he had combined his business in Oxford with a visit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
to young Christopher Froschover, nephew of the printer
of the first English Bible of 1535, who was then an
undergraduate there.</p>

<p>All the authorities I have been able to consult are
unanimous in disagreeing on the history of the family
of Birckman, but fortunately at the moment we are
only concerned with two, Francis the elder and younger.
The elder, whose place of business was in St Paul’s
Churchyard, must have been an important and rich man
and seems to have spared no expense in ornamenting his
books. As an example I may mention the great Sarum
<i>Antiphoner</i> in two folio volumes, of which there is a
copy in the Cambridge University Library. The fine
title-pages were not the stock-in-trade of the printer
Hopyl, but were specially engraved for Birckman, whose
mark occurs in them. His Missals also were profusely
illustrated, which was not the general rule with such
service books.</p>

<p>Francis Birckman was dead before the year 1531,
as we learn from the sentence delivered in a lawsuit
on April 4, 1531, and registered in the sentence book
of the Alderman’s Court at Antwerp. A certain John
Silverlink had delivered to Birckman a large consignment,
over 700 copies, of English New Testaments, for
which he was to be paid £28. 17<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> and had only
received £3. 7<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> The action was brought by the
plaintiff against the guardians of Birckman’s children
to recover the remainder, which was ordered to be paid
minus a sum advanced by Francis Birckman to John
van Remonde. His last book appears to have been
dated 1529. In 1530 an edition of the Sarum <i>Processional</i>,
printed at Paris by Prevost, was published in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
London with the following colophon, “Venundatur
Londonii in edibus junioris Francisci Byrckman apud
cimiterium divi Pauli.” This Francis was no doubt
a son of the earlier Francis, for though his device
is different his mark is the same. The device in
the <i>Processional</i> is the Hen with her Chickens, no
doubt referring to the sign of the Birckmans at
Cologne and Antwerp of the Fat Hen. This is the
only book which I can trace as having been sold in
England by the younger Francis Birckman, who probably
returned abroad. He does not appear to have
printed much, for the business was mainly carried on
by Arnold. At a little later date there were certainly
two Arnold Birckmans flourishing, one who dealt principally
in London, and who had a brother there also
in business named John. The other Arnold whose
headquarters were at Cologne was dead before 1541,
in which year a work of Rupertus, <i>De victoria verbi
Dei</i> was printed at Louvain for the widow of Arnold
Birckman.</p>

<p>John and Arnold were certainly very important
stationers in London. John Reynes was the only
foreigner who surpassed them in wealth, and when his
stock was valued at £100, each of theirs was valued
at 100 marks, that is, £66. 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> They appear to
have acted as foreign agents for many of the London
booksellers and to have travelled a great deal from
place to place. They did not however always bear the
best of characters, for Johann Ulmer writes to Bullinger,
“The Byrckmans are careless and by no means to be
depended upon, therefore beware”; and in another letter
he complains, “The book has not yet reached me, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
Byrckmans are not at all to be trusted.” Erasmus was
even more abusive on the subject.</p>

<p>Jan van Doesborch, a printer of Antwerp who commenced
business some time shortly before 1508, carried
on the tradition of printing English books. Of some
thirty-two books which he issued more than half are in
English and many of them of a very curious nature.
He appears to have inherited the business of Roland
van den Dorp and his widow, and to have taken on
their premises with the sign of the Iron Balance near
the Cammerpoort. He is entered in the books of the
St Lucas Gilde in 1508, the date of his first dated book,
as an illuminator, and this taste is shown in the lavish,
if careless, way in which he illustrated his books.
Probably the first book he issued was the <i>Fifteen
Tokens</i>, a little tract describing the signs coming before
the Judgement and which he had himself translated
from the Dutch. This was followed by three grammars,
one of which, Holt’s <i>Lac Puerorum</i>, has but lately been
discovered and is in a private collection. Then come
an edition of <i>Robin Hood</i>, known from an imperfect copy
in Edinburgh, and a fragment of <i>Eurialus and Lucrece</i>
also at Edinburgh. To the year 1518 may be ascribed
the <i>Life of Virgilius</i> and a dated book of that year,
beginning “This mater treateth of a merchauntes wife
that afterwarde went lyke a man and becam a great
lorde and was called Frederyke of Jennen.” Then we
have the <i>History of Mary of Nemmegen</i>, an edition of <i>Tyl
Howleglas</i>, and the story of the <i>Parson of Kalenborowe</i>.
A last book worthy of mention is one beginning “Of
the newe landes and of ye people found by the messengers
of the kynge of portyngale named Emanuel.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
Though naturally a much spoken of book as being
about the earliest of English books relating to America,
really only one leaf of the book is devoted to that
subject.</p>

<p>Who the translator of these various books may
have been is uncertain. Two were definitely stated to
have been done by Lawrence Andrewe, the London
printer, and Douce without any apparent reason
suggested that others might be the work of Richard
Arnold. I think that perhaps several were translated
by Andrewe. In some verses appended to his translation
of the <i>Book of Dystyllacyon</i> he writes,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">After sondry volumes that I dyd deuyse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As tryfels of myrthe, which were laudable</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>The “sundry trifles of mirth” might well be such
books as <i>Frederick of Jennen</i>, <i>The Life of Virgilius</i>, or
<i>The Parson of Kalenborowe</i>. The only two books to
which he put his name as translator, <i>The wonderful
shape and nature that our Saviour Christ Jesu hath
created in beasts, serpents, fowles</i>, etc., and the <i>Valuation
of gold and silver</i>, hardly come under the head of
“trifles of mirth.”</p>

<p>No doubt this large production of English books
must have entailed frequent visits to England and a
shop or agent there, but the only clue we have to John of
Doesborch’s residence in this country is afforded by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
entry in the lists made for the subsidy of 1523, “De
Johanne van Dwysborow, extraneo, pro xls per annum
ijs.,” and he is entered in the parish of St Martin in
the Fields.</p>

<p>I now come to two printers of Antwerp, in many
ways the most interesting of all, but of whom little is
known and less has been written. These are Christopher
and Hans van Ruremond or Rémonde, who were concerned
very specially with the printing and dispersal of
the first English New Testaments. Whether or not these
two men were related is not very clear, but from the
way they were connected in business it seems very
probable. Christopher, the more important of the two,
was known also as Christopher van Endhoven, which is
the name used on his device and under which he is
entered in 1524 in the registers of the St Lucas Gilde
at Antwerp. Many have thought that Christopher van
Ruremond and Christopher van Endhoven were two
persons, but as all the books in the two names have the
same type and woodcuts, and as in three cases at least
we find the device of Christopher van Endhoven and
the name of Christopher van Ruremond together, we
may take them to be the same. Besides if they were
different persons it would be a very marvellous coincidence
that they should die on the same date, and their
widows simultaneously begin to carry on their businesses.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f8">
<img src="images/fig8.jpg" alt="latin">
</div>

<p>Christopher began to print in 1523, issuing a Sarum
<i>Manual</i> and <i>Processional</i>; this was followed by four
more Sarum service books in 1524 and five in 1525.
Until after February 6, 1525, all were printed for Peter
Kaetz, the later ones for Francis Birckman. In 1526
he entered on a task which was destined to bring him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>into considerable trouble, the printing of the <i>New
Testament</i> in English. In the beginning of the year he
printed a Sarum <i>Breviary</i>, but for the next year we
have nothing else from his press, for a reason to be
noted shortly. In 1527 he printed three <i>Missals</i>, one of
Sarum use, and in 1528 three Sarum service books and
a <i>New Testament</i> in Dutch. For 1529 we have no
books, and 1530 is represented by an English <i>Almanack</i>
and two editions of the Sarum <i>Horae</i>.</p>

<p>In 1525 Christopher and Hans had printed a <i>Bible</i>
in Dutch, Hans printing the greater part of the Old
Testament and Christopher the remainder and the New
Testament. On October 30, 1525, Hans was summoned
before the town council of Antwerp for printing a book
tainted with Lutheran heresies, was ordered to leave
the town and district immediately, and go on pilgrimage
to the Holy Blood at Wilsenaken in Prussia, and was
further forbidden to return to the town or neighbourhood
until he could produce a certificate that the
pilgrimage had been carried out. This he apparently
objected to do and crossed over to England.</p>

<p>Christopher, left in Antwerp, soon afterwards started
on the very dangerous undertaking of printing English
New Testaments, which were sent into England and
sold there by Hans. In 1528 in the table of certain
persons abjured within the diocese of London we find
“John Raimund a Dutchman, for causing fifteen hundred
of Tyndale’s New Testaments to be printed at Antwerp
and for bringing five hundred into England.” John
Raimund is clearly the English form of Jan Roemundt
and is probably identical with the Dutchman who
earlier in the year was in the Fleet for having sold to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
Robert Necton some 200 or 300 copies of the Testament.
At the end of 1526 when these Antwerp printed
Testaments had found their way into England, a strong
effort was made by the English authorities to have them
suppressed and the printer punished. On November 24
John Hackett wrote to Wolsey saying there were two
printers in Antwerp who printed these books but that a
proclamation would soon be issued against them. On
the 12th January, 1527, Hackett again wrote that the
Margrave had declared that according to the Emperor’s
last mandment these English books must be condemned
to be burnt, the printer Christopher Endhoven banished,
and the third part of his goods confiscated. The
prisoner’s counsel however protested against this judgement,
saying that the Emperor’s subjects ought not to
be judged by the laws of other countries, and his plea
seems to have been successful, for Christopher does not
appear to have been banished, and continued to print at
Antwerp. About the end of 1530 he appears to have
crossed over to England in connexion with the sale of
English Testaments, and the last act of the drama is
tersely stated by Foxe under the year 1531. An
Antwerp bookseller named Christopher for selling
certain New Testaments in English to John Row, bookbinder,
was thrown into prison at Westminster and
there died.</p>

<p>On the death of Christopher, Hans wished to return
to Antwerp, but in order to do so a certificate of his
pilgrimage had to be obtained. In the archives of the
city there is an entry dated March 29, 1531, that letters
of the pilgrimage having been presented he was free to
reenter the city and district. He did not stay long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
abroad but returned to London, and as an assistant to
his fellow-countryman John Nicholson, the printer of
Southwark, has been the source of much puzzle to
commentators on the English New Testament; for I
believe him to be no other than John Hollybush, the so-called
reviser of the edition of 1538. The name John
Hollybush has generally been considered a pseudonym,
and most modern authorities consider the person so
designated to have been Miles Coverdale. But Hollybush
was a real person, and in the troubled times of
1535, when inhabitants of the Low Countries dwelling
in England were forced to become denizened, we
find entered amongst others, “John Holibusche alias
Holybusche of London, Stationer otherwise bookbinder,
born in Ruremund, under the obedience of the
Emperor.”</p>

<p>Now considering the prominent part that Hans van
Ruremond, otherwise John Raimund, had taken in the
production and dispersal of the New Testament, he is
just the man to be identical with a stationer who
revised for the press a new edition. The whole family
was identified with the issue of English Testaments.
Christopher printed them at Antwerp, and after he had
died in England for selling them, his widow continued
to print further editions. John had suffered penance
for selling them and was now, in more peaceable times,
helping to print them. Christopher’s son, also named
John, became a printer in Antwerp and printed Dutch
Bibles and Testaments. One of the very last Sarum
service books printed, the <i>Processional</i> of 1558, again
links Christopher van Endhoven and Christopher van
Ruremond together. Upon the title-page is the device<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
with mark and initials, C. E. of Christopher van
Endhoven, while the colophon runs “Finit Processionale
ad usum Sarum Antverpie impressum per Melchiorem
Endovianum, typis Christophori Ruremunden. Anno
m.c.lviii. mensis xxiii. Junii.”</p>

<p>Another stationer connected with Christopher and
Hans van Ruremond was a young man named Peter
Kaetz, who acted for a while as their agent in London
and had a shop in St Paul’s Churchyard. The seven
Sarum service books, two <i>Manuals</i>, two <i>Processionals</i>,
a <i>Horae</i>, a <i>Psalter</i>, and a <i>Hymni cum notis</i>, which
Christopher van Ruremond printed before February 6,
1525, were all to be sold in London by Kaetz; after this
date his place was taken by Birckman. In the spring of
1525 Kaetz returned to Antwerp and carried on business
at the sign of the House of Delft in the Cammerstraete,
a house formerly occupied by Henri Eckert van
Homberg. Here he issued an edition of the <i>Bible</i> in
Dutch printed by Hans van Ruremond. After this date
we hear no more of him. Perhaps like Hans van
Ruremond he was involved in the religious troubles,
and, banished from Antwerp, found refuge in England.
He was in communication with Siberch, the first
Cambridge printer, and amongst some fragments rescued
from a binding of Siberch’s in Westminster Abbey
library was a letter addressed to him by Peter Kaetz.
In it Kaetz says he is waiting in London for his master,
on whose arrival he intends to cross over. He also says,
“I send you 25 prognostications and three New Testaments,
small size. The prognostications cost one shilling
sterling the 25, and the three New Testaments cost
2<i>s.</i> and 6<i>d.</i> sterling.” The puzzling part about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
letter is the date to which it should be assigned. Many
things point to its being before 1523 and yet the
references to the New Testament are not easily explained.
The price is that at which the English New
Testament printed at Antwerp in 1526 by Christopher
van Ruremond was sold, and Hans van Ruremond had
come into England about this time to sell it. We know
also that Christopher van Ruremond printed prognostications
in English. I should have been inclined to
put the letter down to some time in or after 1526, and
to suppose that the master for whom Kaetz waited was
Hans van Ruremond. A person named “Gibkerken” is
mentioned in the letter, who may perhaps be a Dutch
stationer, John Gybken, who was first an assistant to
John Cockes and who afterwards rose to considerable
eminence and was admitted as a member of the
Stationers’ Company. His son was also admitted a
member of the Company, although he was deaf and
dumb.</p>

<p>The history of the printing and dispersal of the
early editions of the English Testament and the various
prohibited controversial books offers a very fascinating
subject of study, and it is extraordinary, considering the
amount that has been written on the question, how little
is really known. I suppose the reason is that it has
usually been taken up from the theological rather than
the bibliographical side, and that writers on the subject
though well versed in the history of the Reformation
knew nothing of scientific bibliography.</p>

<p>It is obvious that where the printer by his work
placed himself in very considerable danger, he would
not be anxious to advertise himself and would therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
let his books go out without any imprint or with a
fictitious one. Then comes in the study of type. It
affords a far more conclusive argument than any theories
drawn from where the author was living or where he
would probably like to have his book printed. Then
again there is the common danger of taking for an early
or original edition what is merely a reprint with the
original colophon unaltered. An important English
library purchased not very long ago at a high price, a
so-called first edition of Tindale’s <i>Parable of the Wicked
Mammon</i>, printed at Marlborowe in the land of Hesse
by Hans Luft, 1528. But in spite of its having this
information emblazoned in gold upon its morocco cover,
it is a reprint made about twenty years later by Berthelet,
a fact that should have been patent to anyone at all
conversant with English printing, seeing that the
title-page is within one of Berthelet’s best-known
border frames.</p>

<p>Then, again, many of the books with foreign imprints
were certainly printed in this country. Upright Hoff
of Leipsic and Ian Troost of Aurich are both names
assumed by John Oswen, the printer of Ipswich.</p>

<p>Cambridge has made an important start towards
a real bibliography of this subject by the publication of
the third volume of Mr Sayle’s most admirable <i>Catalogue
of the Early English Books in the University Library</i>.
Only those who have worked on the subject can understand
how much patience, how much untiring labour,
and how many often disappointing searches must have
been expended on every small fact chronicled in the
volume.</p>

<p>To return to these Early English Testaments printed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
in Antwerp. It is quite clear that as soon as the edition
printed by Schoeffer in 1525 had been issued and found
a ready sale, the Antwerp printers set to work to print
rival editions. Fortunately we have a very clear and
contemporary account which there seems no reason for
doubting. It occurs in Joye’s <i>Apology</i>, written about
1534, and I will abbreviate it as far as possible. “Thou
shalt know that Tyndale translated and printed the
New Testament in a mean great volume but yet without
Kalendar, Concordances in the margin, and Table in the
end. And anon, after, the Dutchmen got a copy and
printed it again in a small volume adding the Kalendar
in the beginning, Concordances in the margin, and the
Table in the end.” After speaking of the many faults
in it he continues: “After this they printed it again
also without a corrector in a greater letter and volume
with the figures in the Apocalypse which was therefore
much falser than their first. When these two prints
(there were of them both about five thousand printed)
were all sold more than a twelvemonth ago [that is
about the middle of 1533] Tyndale was pricked forth to
take the Testament in hand. But Tyndale prolonged
and deferred in so much that in the mean season the
Dutchmen printed it again the third time in a small
volume like their first print, but much more false than
ever it was before.” Before this edition was put in
hand Joye had been asked to correct it, but refused,
saying that Tindale was about to bring out a revised
edition: however two thousand copies were printed and
sold almost at once. A fourth edition was then put in
hand and Joye was again asked to correct it. He
continues: “I answered as before that if Tyndale<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
amend it, with so great diligence as he promiseth yours
will be never sold. Yes, quod they, for if he print two
thousand and we as many, what is so little a number
for all England? and we will sell ours better cheap and
therefore we doubt not of the sale.” Joye seeing clearly
that they were determined to print whether he corrected
or not, and seeing he was more qualified than a native,
undertook the task, and for the modest remuneration of
fourpence halfpenny for every sheet of sixteen leaves
corrected the edition published by the widow of
Christopher van Endhoven in August, 1534. According
to this statement, which is a very lucid one, between
the issue of Tindale’s octavo version in 1525 and Joye’s
revision in 1534, three other Antwerp editions had
been issued. The first in a very small volume with
a Kalendar, marginal notes, and a table. This must be
the edition printed by Christopher van Endhoven in
1526 for which he was prosecuted. The second was of
a larger size and had woodcuts to the Apocalypse.
The third was similar to the first, but much more
incorrectly printed. Here then are three editions as
yet entirely unidentified, and there are most probably
more. The late Dr Angus possessed the title-page of
an edition of 1532 which from the tracing reproduced
in Demaus’ book on Tindale must have been a quarto.</p>

<p>Antwerp continued to print Testaments in increasing
numbers. In 1534 and 1535 four editions were issued,
and in 1536 when they were more freely circulated, no
less than seven. These are beyond our period, but I
cannot resist chronicling a fact lately come to light,
which gives the solution of a long-standing puzzle. In
all the three quarto editions of 1536, none of which has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
a printer’s name, is a woodcut of St Paul with his foot
resting on a stone. These cuts though almost exactly
similar are not identical. In one cut nothing is engraved
on the stone, and the edition containing it is
known as the “blank stone” edition. In another cut
a mole is engraved on the stone, and the edition is
known as the “mole” edition. In the third there is
what is called an engraver’s mark, with the initials
A. K. B., and that issue is called the “engraver’s mark”
edition. Now about this engraver’s mark nothing was
known. Not long ago, however, in turning over a large
volume of miscellaneous woodcuts in the Bodleian I
came across an example of this cut on what was
manifestly the last leaf of a book. Below the cut was
this colophon, “Antwerp. Mattheus Cromme voor
Adriaen Kempe van Bouckhout, 1537.” Between 1537
and 1539 Crom printed for Kempe several editions of
Branteghem’s <i>Vita Jesu Christi</i>. In 1536 the cut
occurs in the <i>Storys and prophesis out of the holy
scriptur</i> printed by Simon Cock. It would thus seem
that Kempe first employed Cock as his printer, but left
him for Crom when the latter began printing about 1537.</p>

<p>The specimens of bookbinding of this period, the
best so far as stamped bindings are concerned, offer
a very difficult problem to the student. What are
English bindings and what are not, and how are they
to be distinguished? The more the subject is studied,
the more difficult these questions appear. There are
bindings which are obviously English just as there are
others obviously foreign, but the great majority are
doubtful. It must be remembered that a very large
number of binders in England were foreigners, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
would very likely bring their dies and stamps with
them from abroad, and finish their work in a foreign
manner. As their bindings were produced in England,
they must be called English bindings though in a foreign
style, for we would not call the Berthelet bindings, produced
for Henry VIII in London by foreign workmen
with foreign dies, anything but English.</p>

<p>As an example of this confusion I would mention
the binding on a copy of the <i>Horae ad usum Sarum</i> of
1506, printed for Pelgrim and Jacobi, and now in the
Bodleian. In the centre of the cover are two purely
Netherlandish panels, while round these runs a frame
composed of two dies which had belonged to Caxton.
We know that the partners owned several of Caxton’s
dies, because they are found in conjunction with Jacobi’s
signed panels. As the <i>Horae</i> was printed for them and
has their dies on the binding, it is clear they are the
binders, but had the Caxton dies been absent, no one
could have put down the binding as anything but
Netherlandish.</p>

<p>The favourite English binding of this time consisted
of two panel stamps, one having the Royal Arms,
the other the Tudor Rose with mottoes, which I described
before. In the base of these panels the binder’s
initials and mark generally occur. In some cases these
initials can with certainty be ascribed, because they
occur with the mark and full name in some printed
book. Thus there is no mistake about the bindings of
Pynson, Notary, Jacobi, or Reynes. But in a large
number of cases there are merely initials, or initials
with a mark which has not been identified. Here the
imagination steps in with usually fatal results.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>One set of these panels is signed R. O., and as O is
an uncommon initial for a surname the natural inclination
is to attribute the binding to Reginald Oliver.
Another set has the initials R. L.: who more likely
than Richard Lant? All such suggestions are worthless
without proof, and until proved are not worth setting
down. Other binders using these panels were H. N.
and G. G.</p>

<p>A binder whose initials were G. R. had two very
handsome pairs of panels. One panel contains the
Royal Arms surrounded by the verse beginning, “Confitemini
dominum quoniam bonus,” while the corresponding
panel contains figures of four saints. The
first of the second pair is also the Royal Arms with the
verse beginning “Laudate Dominum de terra,” and the
other has the figures of the four saints, George, Barbara,
Michael, and Katherine.</p>

<p>The Annunciation was a very favourite subject with
bookbinders. One of the handsomest panels of this
kind was used by a binder, A. H., who used also a panel
with the Tudor Rose. Though this shows that the
bindings were produced for the English market, the
leather employed, apparently sheepskin, suggests that
they were executed abroad, perhaps at Rouen.</p>

<p>Two other panels were in common use containing
figures of St Sebastian and St Roche. These were
extremely popular, for at that time the country was
periodically visited with outbreaks of the plague, against
which these two saints were considered the guardians.
Very often the saint chosen for the binder’s panel had
reference to his own Christian name. John Reynes
has a panel with St John Baptist. St George as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
patron saint of England was naturally popular. One
beautiful binding has on one side St George and the
Dragon, and on the other St Michael with the binder’s
devices, a maiden’s head on a shield. This might be
the work of Richard Faques, who lived at the sign of
the Maiden’s Head.</p>

<p>The roll binding, as apart from the panel binding,
was ornamented by means of a rolling tool, and at first
these were large and ornamental, but they gradually
narrowed, and so became meagre or weak in detail.</p>

<p>Those in use at Cambridge are perhaps the finest of
all, but this is not the time to speak of them. Among
London binders John Reynes produced the best known
roll, containing figures of a hound, a falcon, and a bee
with flowers and foliage. Another with an unknown
binder’s mark, contains a hound, a falcon, and a double-headed
eagle on a shield. The roll of another unknown
binder bears a Tudor Rose, a pomegranate, a shield
with the arms of France and England, a turreted
gateway, a portcullis, a fleur-de-lys, and the binder’s
mark.</p>

<p>Another handsome roll has the initials of I. G. and
W. G. with figures of a dragon, a gryphon, and foliage,
and is not at all uncommon. In Archbishop Marsh’s
library at Dublin there is an example of such a binding,
tooled entirely in gold, the only example I have ever
seen of such work.</p>

<p>In the main design of all these English rolls there
is very little variation, the various royal emblems amidst
foliage and flowers.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that while we have so many
initialled bindings which cannot be definitely ascribed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
to particular binders, so also we have the names of
plenty of binders to whom we cannot allot bindings;
Alard and Noel Havy, De Worde’s binders, Giles Lauret,
who lived close to Havy in Shoe Lane, and John Rouse,
who lived next door. John Richardson, and John Row
who was punished for buying Testaments. John Pollard
and Thomas Stoke who received pardon for some unknown
offence in 1533. Martin Dotier, the third offender,
we do find afterwards, for he commissioned one edition
of a Sarum <i>Manual</i> in 1543, and ended his days as
a brother of the Stationers’ Company.</p>

<p>Few binders or stationers of the time have left any
definite record. I have notes of at least four hundred
persons connected with the English book-trade between
the years 1500 and 1535, but of very few is anything
known beyond the name. A mention in a will, an
entry in a record or tax-roll, or a mention in church
or municipal accounts, is all that remains to tell us
of their existence.</p>

<p>I have referred before to the various difficulties
with which the foreign stationer had to contend, and
year by year these difficulties grew worse. The educated
man was still entirely dependent on the Continent
for such books as he required, for before 1535 the literature
of the Renaissance was untouched by the native
printers. Wynkyn de Worde from start to finish, roughly
speaking, never printed a classic, but was content to turn
out rhymes and romances to catch the popular taste.
Pynson, the more scholarly worker, was engaged on official
or semi-official publications. There was no press that
could print in any but ordinary type; even the most
learned printer had not sufficient Greek letters to print<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
quotations; and this when foreigners came to England
to learn Greek.</p>

<p>No doubt the large importation of books was galling
to the native printers, but they do not seem to have
lacked work, or if they did it was only through their
own want of energy. The bookbinders were in a much
worse case, because so many binders in this country
were foreigners, and no doubt large consignments of
books came over ready bound. The probability is that
the foreigners had been better trained, and could turn
out cheaper and better work, and though that might
appeal to the purchaser, it would certainly injure their
native rivals. While for forty years the Italians had
been issuing beautiful little volumes in gilt bindings,
the use of gilding on bindings was almost unknown in
England. It was not as though English printing was
improving as time went on. Indeed it became more
and more careless and slovenly. A printer here and
there who had a subsidy and was sure of work, such as
Pynson and Berthelet, cast fine type and produced handsome
books. But the majority lagged far behind, and
worn-out type and broken cuts were the stock-in-trade
of the ordinary printer. Then was passed the Act of
1534, which declared the English printers to be at least
the equals of any foreign competitors, and restricted
the importation of foreign books. With the removal of
the foreign competition native work sank to its lowest
level, and it was only when the religious persecutions
abroad drove numbers of refugee foreign printers to
England that English printing began to revive—for
the time.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day, 1534, probably but a few days<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
before the death of Wynkyn de Worde, the famous Act
of 25 Henry VIII concerning printers and binders of
books came into operation. The preamble is extremely
clear and interesting: “Whereas by the provision of
a statute made in the first year of the reign of king
Richard III [1484] it was provided in the same Act,
that all strangers repairing into this realm, might lawfully
bring into the said realm printed and written
books to sell at their liberty and pleasure. By force
of which provision there hath come into this realm
sithen the making of the same a marvellous number of
printed books, and daily doth; and the cause of making
of the same provision seemeth to be, for that there
were but few books, and few printers, within this realm
at that time, which could well exercise and occupy the
said science and craft of printing; nevertheless, sithen
the making of the said provision, many of this realm,
being the king’s natural subjects, have given themselves
so diligently to learn and exercise the said craft of
printing, that at this day there be within this realm
a great number of cunning and expert in the said
science or craft of printing, as able to exercise the said
craft in all points, as any stranger in any other realm
or country. And furthermore, where there be a great
number of the king’s subjects within this realm, which
live by the craft and mystery of binding of books, and
that there be a great multitude well expert in the
same, yet all this notwithstanding there are divers
persons, that bring from beyond the sea great plenty
of printed books, not only in the Latin tongue, but also
in our maternal English tongue, some bound in boards,
some in leather, and some in parchment, and them sell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
by retail, whereby many of the king’s subjects, being
binders of books, and having no other faculty, wherewith
to get their living, be destitute of work, and like
to be undone, except some reformation be herein had.
Be it therefore enacted by the king our sovereign lord,
the lords spiritual and temporal, and the commons in
this present parliament assembled, and by authority of
the same, that the said proviso, made the first year of
the said king Richard III, from the feast of the nativity
of our Lord God next coming, shall be void and of
none effect.”</p>

<p>This part of the Act, which seems to me essentially
fair, simply removed special privileges and put the
foreign printers and stationers on an equal footing with
all other aliens. Then come two special new enactments.</p>

<p>“And further, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid,
that no persons resiant or inhabitant within this
realm, after the said feast of Christmas next coming,
shall buy to sell again, any printed books, brought from
any parts out of the king’s obeysance, ready bound in
boards, leather or parchment, upon pain to lose and
forfeit for every book bound out of the said king’s
obeysance, and brought into this realm and bought by
any person or persons within the same to sell again
contrary to this Act, 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>”</p>

<p>This enactment was a great protection to native
binders as prohibiting all dealing in foreign bound
books. The next paragraph was for the benefit of the
printers. “And be it further enacted, by the authority
aforesaid, that no person or persons inhabitant or resiant
within this realm after the said feast of Christmas shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
buy within this realm of any stranger born out of the
king’s obedience, other than of denizens, any manner of
printed books brought from any the parts beyond the
sea, except only by engross and not by retail upon pain
of forfeiture of 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for every book so bought by
retail contrary to the form and effect of this estature.”</p>

<p>The remainder of the Act treats only of penalties
and restrictions as to the price of books and bindings.</p>

<p>The clause about printing amounts to this, that no
person not a native or denizen could retail foreign
printed books, and it seems pretty clear that it was not
so much intended for the advantage of printers, as for
giving fuller power to suppress the importation and
surreptitious sale of controversial books.</p>

<p>The alien printer, stationer, or binder, when denizened,
was in this position. He paid double subsidies
and taxes, he could have none but English-born apprentices
and only two foreign workmen. He was
under the rule of the Warden of the Craft. He could
not deal in foreign bound books, nor buy books from
foreigners except by engross. The alien not denizened
had the further restrictions that unless he had been
a householder before February 1528, he could not keep
any house or shop in which to exercise any handicraft,
nor could he sell any foreign printed books by retail.</p>

<p>Weighed down by these various disabilities the small
foreign stationers rapidly disappeared. A certain number
who had lived here for some time took out letters of
denization and stayed on, but it was only to struggle on.</p>

<p>If you wish to have a practical idea of what foreign
work meant to England, just glance at the list of Contents
in Mr Sayle’s admirable <i>Catalogue of the Early</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
<i>English books in the University Library</i>. Taking all
the persons given in the list, from the earliest printing
to 1510 connected with English books, we have the
astonishing result of three Englishmen, Caxton, a printer,
Hunte, the Oxford stationer, and W. Bretton, merely
a patron of printing. The foreigners on the other hand
number forty-two. After 1510 the relative numbers
rapidly alter, and by 1535 the great majority were
English. The hatred of the natives, and the various
Acts levelled against him, compelled the foreign workman
to disappear, and I am afraid that with his disappearance
the necessary competition which produced
good printing disappeared also.</p>

<p>The fifty years of freedom from 1484 to 1534 not only
brought us the finest specimens of printing we possess,
but compelled the native workman, in self-protection,
to learn, and when competition was done away with his
ambition rapidly died also. Once our English printing
was protected, it sank to a level of badness which has
lasted, with the exception of a few brilliant experiments,
almost down to our own day.</p>
